Due to the way electoral votes are allocated, candidates have a strong incentive to focus their campaigns on ""swing"" states with many voters, such as Florida, and neglect states such as Texas which do not swing.   Due to necessary rounding errors when allocating votes, members of a sparsely populated state effectively accrue more voting power than members of a well-populated state.  This increases the electoral power of members of certain states while reducing it for others on an ongoing basis.

It has been presented to Google and TED.com.  Videos below.

Liquid-Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR) has been proven by previous US research and operated for nearly 5 years (1965-1969).

LFTR is PASSIVELY safe.  During a loss of power or overheating, nuclear fuel is separated (passively) into  non-critical holding tanks.  It runs at low pressure compared to existing reactors.

LFTR is CHEAP, proliferation adverse, and domestic.

Thorium has proven reserves of well over 1000 years of current world usage.

Thorium could produce power for the entire world at levels far beyond current production.

Imagine a world with nearly infinite power.

The IRS could curtail such claims almost immediately if tax refund claims were screened against the SSA's Death Master File & matching cases identified for special processing.

This filter, together with other viable and easily implemented safeguards, could actually EXPEDITE the processing of such claims.

A prosecutor who does not understand proportionality and who regularly uses the threat of unjust and overreaching charges to extort plea bargains from defendants regardless of their guilt is a danger to the life and liberty of anyone who might cross her path.

What can you tell us about Bowe's whereabouts and welfare?

What have YOU done in your presidency to find and free Bowe?

Do you have any plans to bring Bowe Home?

Is there any chance that Bowe may have been  a casualty in any U.S. drone strike during your presidency?

Without medicine, animals are prone to death by disease, as well as starvation or predation, especially as populations grow; those which do survive often move into human habitats and cause damage.

Cetacean's in the wild remain with their families for life, in captivity mother and calf are separated usually after 2 years.
In the wild a female cetacean gives birth every 3 to 10 years, and has her first calf at roughly 15 years of age. In captivity the female is bred as early as 7 year's old and give's birth every 2 to 5 years.

We understand that some men and women are unfit to parent, and judges should rule accordingly in the best interest of the children. If both parents are found to be fit and proper an equal parenting time arrangement should be the standard. Research shows that children of divorce benefit greatly with the opportunity to have a fair and equal relationship with both  parents. All across our country the future and well being of our children are being put at risk from unfair parenting arrangements handed down from judges in cases that never even go to trial.

These videos then need to be reviewed by a Civilian Review Board. Why? Because all too often the ""Blue Code"" keeps officers from being reprimanded for their behavior.

One of the major issues that will be faced is that Police turn their cameras off before they partake in behavior unbecoming of an Officer of the Law. As such, these cameras should ALWAYS be on. Turning them off should be seen as suspicious behavior. Multiple ""malfunctions"" should also lead to investigation of tampering with the camera.

In 2012, the FL resident was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot into a wall in an effort to protect herself from her abusive husband. Attorneys for Alexander attempted to raise the ""Stand Your Ground"" Defense, but the judge did not allow her to use the defense, noting that she could have run out of her home to escape her husband. Alexander's warning shot injured no one, except the dry wall in her home; yet she was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

In light of the acquittal of George Zimmerman, where clearly a life was taken, surely Alexander, who took no life, deserves her freedom.

Therefore, I propose that funding for Lyme disease be increased by $200 M per year with 50% of that being devoted to finding a cure to Chronic Lyme disease and related co-infections.

Yes, but NOT in the way you're thinking.
White Genocide is Whites being forced to assimilate with the third-worlders that are being flooded into all White countries, so that we'll be blended out of existence by intermarriage.
But Whites must also be taught that White Genocide is morally necessary.
So anti-whites scream at us, ""Racist! Racist! Racist!, and teach schoolchildren that we're responsible for all the world's evil.
They instill the hatred that produces brutal crimes against us, and instill self-hatred in Whites that makes us accept both our genocide and the brutality that accompanies it.

According to USA Today, that puts them just behind Exxon Mobile and Apple for having the most profitable 2013. The nation's student loan debt now surpasses auto loans and credit card debt yet the government has done nothing to address these issues. America deserves better.

In order for America to maintain its preeminence into the 21st century, it is essential that we incentivize our young people to attend college without worrying about financially jeopardizing their future. Therefore, we ask the government to make all student loan payments tax deductible. Enacting such legislation will reward those American who wish to attend college and responsibly pay off their loans, as payments will not be taxed as income.",6950,100000,30,Closed,"Budget & Taxes,Education"

This letter concluded that the tornado that swept through Central Illinois on Nov 27th had done approximately 6.1 million dollars in damage. This is far below the thresh hold of 17.8 million dollars needed to qualify for aid. These thresholds are arbitrary, and while they may represent a good place to start, they should not be used in such a definitive manner.

The people of this area are the backbone of America. We are hard working, blue collar, middle class, tax paying Americans. If no relief from our Government will come now, then surely there is no time we will ever receive relief.

We urge that FEMA reconsider their decision to not grant aid to the area.

Legislation needs to put into action NOW that stops this from happening! The AD plan is a very bad idea as it will actually cost much more and removes the balance of power between AD and NG.

The Guard has the same aviation flight requirements, costs 2/3rds less, & does just as well as AD. The Army would increase its vulnerability by axing 1/3rd of the MOST experienced aviators & mechanics. It would take 20+ years to train an equally experienced replacement force. An alternative: the Guard retains all 8 Combat Aviation Brigades, plus move 2 AD CABs to the NG. Doing so would save $1 BILLION annually!

Most people have not heard of AS. In fact, many doctors haven't.

The symptoms of AS are extremely severe. Mental retardation, nearly complete lack of speech, and severe difficulty with motor control occur in all individuals. Seizures occur in almost all individuals.

Individuals with AS and their family members are enduring incredible hardship. However, there is hope.

A cure for AS is on the horizon. The cause is now well understood - a rarity amongst genetic syndromes.

All that is required now is the funding to make a cure possible.

In 2010, the National Institutes of Health spent less than $500,000 on Angelman Syndrome research.

With a healthcare system expanding, more people are covered under insurance but over 50% of physicians will be retiring in the next 15 years.
The financial burden placed in the shoulders of medical students is irresponsible of the U.S. Government, which has implemented new laws expanding healthcare coverage for millions of Americans.
Physician pay is in decline but debt is on the rise. The U.S. Government should take the necessary steps to ensure competent and capable students enter the physician profession.  This could be accomplished by subsidizing medical school loans for tuition, lowering ridiculous interest rates even more and developing more loan/debt forgiveness programs.

See StudentLoanJustice.Org for more.,"Unlike all other loans in this country, Federal and Private student loans have been uniquely stripped of the most fundamental consumer protections, including bankruptcy protections, statutes of limitations, and others.

At the same time, collection powers, and financial incentives have been created for these loans that make defaulted loans more lucrative for the lenders, guarantors, and even the federal government in many instances!

The result has been a predatory, inflationary lending system which works against the students by design, and in a bad-faith manner.  This must end.

Congress and the President created this problem through legislation.  Similarly, Congress and the President must correct this problem NOW.

Research has shown that Rett syndrome can be reversed in mice.  Gene therapy is also showing promise.

Tammy Zywicki, a 21-year-old student at Grinnell College,  was abducted at mile marker 83 on I-80 in Lasalle County, IL, on Aug. 23, 1992. Her body was found alongside I-44 near Springfield, MO, on Sept. 1, 1992. The FBI assisted local law enforcement agencies with the investigation. By early 1993, the combined task force was disbanded. To date, no one has been brought to justice for this heinous crime.

The 22 years since this tragedy have seen major advances in the fields of Forensic Science and Criminology. A new Task Force using these modern techniques could finally bring Tammy, and her family and friends, some justice. ",700,100000,30,Closed,Criminal Justice Reform

Another Fort Hood type tragedy can be stopped or lessened by having trained personnel with a Concealed Weapons Permit be the first responders.

We believe that the DoD should set forth Concealed Carry regulations permitting service members in good standing who have received firearms training and certification, to also be certified to carry concealed firearms on DoD installations.

Please help share our cause and petition.

Many species of fish, including pelagic fish, whales, sharks, turtles and others are on the verge of extinction due to many factors. But the worst threat is from longline fishing, where fishing boats use hundreds of lines miles long with thousand of hooks. These 'longlines' not only catch protected species but they also snag unintended fish as they are trawled through the water. It is the equivalent of strip mining the ocean.

The commercial and recreative fisherman from Puerto Rico have been affected for the last 10 years because of this longliners fish so close to the shore ( aprox 9 nautical miles) that our fishing business and recreation is no longer an option for making a living.

Despite what the organizers and their supporters say, the Constitution unequivocally sets up a fire wall between church and state - and the organizers behind the National Prayer Breakfast attempt to extinguish that inviolate, absolute and permanent separation.

The participants of the National Prayer Breakfast compose a cohort of homophobic and anti-choice zealots who are out of the mainstream, and represent no more than 30% of the US population.

XL travels over sensitive lands such as wetlands and aquifers where spills can damage endangered species' habitat and contaminate potable water.

Economically, the current price of crude oil makes it impossible for the pipeline to produce positive revenues. The capital labor added to the economy will only bolster employment temporarily.

Instead, the Department of Energy should invest funds into alternative clean energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal. Development into sustainable energy will provide lasting jobs, promote a healthy environment, and lessen the country's reliance on fossil fuels.

Current crime statistics:
Police deaths = 52 per 100 000
Farmer deaths = 330 per 100 000

Your chances of dying in South Africa as a farmer is three times higher then that of a police officer in the country.

There was roughly 128 000 commercial farmers in South Africa in 1980, today there are 40 000 commercial farmers left in the country.

The Government dismisses this demographic as just crime, when in fact minority groups in the country should be considered into this factor.

If implemented, the policy installs new barriers that would limit and potentially deny access to appropriate prosthetic care. It eliminates coverage for certain prosthetic devices that amputees depend on for every step they take every day. It even would preclude amputees from using a prosthesis if they failed to meet the entirely nebulous and subjective standard of ""the appearance of natural gait"" while using the prosthesis.

Equally troublesome, the proposed policy contains no references to clinical or medical evidence supporting the changes.

For all of these reasons, the draft policy should be rescinded.

Right now, many people with disabilities are penalized because they require services to survive. These services are through both federal and state programs.

These programs include (but are not limited to) Medicaid, SSDI/SSI, and even section 8 or food stamps. They are often the only programs to offer what can be life-saving services. For example, only state Medicaid will pay for PCA based home healthcare. No private insurances will cover this.

In May of 2011, you visited Poland and met with the then Prime Minister, Donald Tusk. As is customary, the Prime Minister presented you with several gifts of friendship on behalf of the Polish people. One of these gifts was a copy of the Video Game ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"".

Obviously, you've had more important tasks to attend to in the intervening years, but as your term in office approaches its end, would it be possible for you to play at least a portion of the game and perhaps share some of your thoughts on it or the Video Game industry in general?

The oldest rates such as Boatswain Mates, and Gunners Mate predate the founding of this country. Being known by your job title was a sense of pride. A sign of accomplishment.  The Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations just senselessly erased this tradition. One only has to visit Navy social media pages to see the disgust and outrage of current and former personnel.  One by one current leadership continues to erode the very things that set the Navy apart from the other services. Mr. President, I and the others signing this petition request you use your authority to restore to our Sailors what they have earned.",25326,100000,30,Public,
4094,25881,,Reverse decision made by SECNAV to remove Rating system for Sailors.,"SECNAV, CNO, and the current and previous MCPON have spat in the face of 241 years of Naval tradition and heritage by removing the rating system. Sailors have always identified with their Rate, from Master At Arms, Gunners Mate, Hospital Corpsman etc, these titles are an integral part of everyday life in the Navy. The shortening of titles to MA1, GM2 or HM3 had allowed succinct, simple and respectful communication between sailors. Removing these titles and abbreviations is not honorable. There is no courage in bowing to political pressure to be ""PC"". There is no commitment to your Sailors in voiding 241 years of history to make titles sound better. This decision is contrary to the core values of the Navy. Order SECNAV to reverse course immediately and poll every sailor for an opinion first",347,100000,30,Public,
