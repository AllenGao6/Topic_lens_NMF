Kildare’s Irish Pub closes due to collegiate housing project,"Kildare’s Irish Pub served its last drink.

The company announced Friday on its Facebook page that it closed due to the construction of a mixed-use collegiate housing project.

“Unfortunately, due to construction beginning we have had to close earlier than expected effective immediately so demolition can begin on our building,” the Facebook post said. “We have loved being here with you for the last five and a half years, Penn State. You are an amazing group of charitable, smart and incredibly fun people and we are grateful to have served you. We are ... going to miss you all.”

Kildare’s general manager Lincoln Stuyvesant told the Centre Daily Times in November that the pub’s lease ran into 2017. He believed that they would stay at 538 E. College Ave. through at least 2016.

The prime real estate on the east side of downtown State College was sold for $7.5 million to Chicago developers that will build a 12-story structure. CA Student Living bought the property from Jeff Haas, who advocated for collegiate housing overlay projects to be developed on the 500 block of East College Avenue. The company specializes in investment, development and management in student housing.

The developers could reach the maximum height allowed — which was 65 feet until July 6 — if they design a building with commercial space on the first floor and two floors of mixed graduate and professional housing. They also have to draw up sustainable features that meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards.

Haas told the CDT in an email he wanted to develop the property but couldn’t pass up CA Student Living’s offer.

“It was always our intention to develop the property,” he said. “After the collegiate housing overlay was approved we were contacted by CA Student Living. (Due to) the combination of the financial opportunity and that CA shared our vision for a high quality multiuse building for the property we thought it was in our best interest and the best interest of the State College borough for continued downtown development of high quality, multiuse buildings ... to sell the property.”",Centre Daily Times
"Development, budget among top issues
Newspaper","For the Centre Region and the municipalities therein, 2015 marked a year of development.

Whether or not that development is a good thing remains in the opinions of the residents and the future of the region.

Carrying over from Planning Commission discussions in 2014, the State College Borough Council prolonged holding a final vote on the collegiate housing overlay amendment. The overlay, in part proposed by the former owner of Kildare’s Irish Pub, sought to motivate developers to create better designs and allowed flexibility in building height, parking requirements and floor area ratios.

A public hearing in April saw a strong residential lean against the overlay, with many residents questioning the need for more student housing. Residents also voiced their concerns about increased traffic in the area.

A decision on the overlay finally came in July with a 6-1 vote in favor of the amendment. While residents again voiced their opposition to the amendment, President Jim Rosenberger said the proposal puts density at the border of town and gown where it should be.

Things remained quiet regarding the overlay until December, when CA Ventures proposed the RISE — a 12-story, 182-unit commercial and residential development that would overtake Kildare’s and the neighboring Colony Apartments. the conditional use permit for the RISE on Dec. 21.

Meanwhile, in Ferguson Township, residents railed against a development they said threatened the very ecology of the region.

Opposition against the Cottages at State College, a 268-unit housing project by Toll Brothers slated to take in more than 1,000 occupants, ramped up in May. Residents were wary about the development’s proximity to the Harter-Thomas wellfields, which provides drinking water to the State College Borough Water Authority.

Submission deadlines for a final plan from the developer continued to be pushed back until November, when by the Board of Supervisors to the boos and cries of “shame” from the residents in attendance.

PennTerra Engineering President John Sepp told the board the plan was “one of the cleanest plans I’ve ever presented to the Board of Supervisors for a job this size.”

But the issue of the Cottages will continue into the new year, as group calling itself the Nittany Valley Water Coalition filed suit on Dec. 15 against the township supervisors, seeking to overturn the decision to approve the development plan. The issue is also likely to be revisited by the incoming supervisors in January.

Residents in College Township wondered “what stinks?” in March when an “unbearable” odor was found emanating from the nearby University Area Joint Authority water treatment facility.

The UAJA had kicked off an odor-control study in August 2014, collecting air samples and inviting residents to submit their own off-site odor observations. UAJA Executive Director Cory Miller cited maintenance at the compost building as the cause of the recent changes in odor.

In May, the UAJA detailing its current findings into the study, saying changes are being made around the facility but permanent solutions likely won’t be seen until 2016.

“We’ve made an awful lot of operational changes to various processes here, and it seems to be making a significant difference, “ Miller said. “We still have some other things we have to work on, but I think we’re making great progress on those changes before the final report is done.”

Regionally, future cyclists should find travel from one end of the Centre Region to the other a bit easier thanks to the Centre Region bicycle plan, which frames the paths and connections throughout the community.

Creation of the plan was sparked by the League of American Bicyclists, which named the State College region as a bronze-level bicycling area, Centre Region Planning Agency senior transportation planner Trish Meek said. As part of the award, the league provided feedback to the region that recommended the development of a comprehensive regional bike program.

After about a year of collecting input from municipal officials and cyclists themselves, a plan was presented to the Centre Region Council of Governments, who . The plan now identifies critical gaps in the regional bike plan and seeks to fill the gaps with logical connections while increasing the recognition that bikes are a legitimate form of transportation.

For Centre County itself, budget woes have put the crunch on some county-provided services and threatens to throw the county deeper into debt.

In August, while the state budget was still less than two months late, county commissioners assured residents that the county could weather the lack of state funding. Commissioners cited repeatedly that the county would be financed through December if the budget impasse lasted that long.

Now, as the sixth month of the budget impasse comes to a close, Centre County reserves are running out. The county Youth Service Bureau reported at the beginning of December that surrounding counties are unable to pay providers, putting pressure on the bureau.

A few weeks later, on Dec. 23, a $10 million Tax and Revenue Anticipation Note meant to carry the county financially through February. A tentative county budget was passed a week later.

“There is no good scenario here to adjust how we are going to continue without state funding,” Chairman Steve Dershem said. “I hope that we get back to some level of normalcy in our budgeting cycle, because it’s not fair to anybody.”",Centre Daily Times
Year in review: No shortage of business moves in 2015,"It’s impossible to make a top 10 business stories list.

What follows isn’t in any particular order.

It also isn’t just 10 stories. Some categories are specific to a single story, but most entail a series of stories or similar tales.

Businesses close, open, get sold, developed and bought at an astonishingly fast pace in Centre County. Here were a few of those from 2015.

Businesses go up in flames, vow comebacks

Jim Waite, Robert Khayat and Bob Ricketts have an unfortunate situation in common — each of their businesses caught fire in 2015.

They each said, however, that they would rebound.

Ricketts will Fasta and Ravioli Co. in early 2016 in downtown State College by taking the the place of sister company Good Seed Baking Co. He also plans to reopen his store in Pleasant Gap where a fire damaged it on Christmas Eve.

Waite’s business, Jim’s Garage, and several of his classic cars in Bellefonte were destroyed in January. Khayat’s Penns Mobil burned down in February. All have said they to rebuild.

Kildare’s property sold for development

CA Student Living the property where Kildare’s is located for $7.5 million in October.

Previous land owner Jeff Haas advocated for collegiate housing overlay projects to be developed on the 500 block of East College Avenue, and the Chicago based developers at CA Student Living could build an 11 story, 124-foot mixed-use building

It is unclear if the restaurant is in CA Student Living’s plans.

Study reveals growing fitness industry

A deeper look into the fitness industry more fitness-related businesses opening in State College.

A Centre Daily Times study, published in March, identified 31 fitness centers, including gyms, yoga studios and martial arts studios, in and around the State College area. There are 14 businesses that opened prior to 2010 and 17 in the past five years.

Local business owners said increased interest in health has enabled more fitness-related businesses to open.

CBICC, Penn State sign memorandum of agreement

The Chamber of Business and Industry of Centre County and Penn State agreed to in an effort to drive the area’s economy and fortunes of entrepreneurs.

CBICC President Vern Squier and Penn State President Eric Barron touted the partnership in a May announcement.

Under the plan, the university will work with the CBICC to turn Penn State ideas into businesses that stay in the community after the students graduate.

Small businesses matter

And, honestly, it’s not hard to find studies that say small businesses mean more to the local economy.

The CDT focused on small businesses for its annual Business Matters publications in February, publishing stories about how some small businesses in the county have been passed down for multiple , how others are unique and looking into small business trends.

Small businesses are, after all, the of our county.

Mo Valley Medical Building opens

Penn Highlands Healthcare unveiled the 23,000-square-foot Moshannon Valley Community Medical Building in Rush Township in November.

It opened its doors the same month.

The $6 million project near the intersection of North Front and Railroad streets was aided by two grants, one totaling $1.75 million from the state Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program, as well as a $1 million Highmark Community Investment grant.

A&P site bought for development

Win Development, based in Florida, bought the long vacant A&P supermarket property for $2.85 in April.

Patton Township’s Board of Supervisors approved plans for the site in June.

Mattress Firm and Qdoba Mexican Grill will occupy the retail-restaurant space. Vitamin Shoppe and Great Clips will take the dual retail space, and Panda Express will be a stand-alone restaurant.

Snow Shoe pipeline work

Superior Appalachian Pipeline installed 7 miles of pipe in Snow Shoe Township.

The project began in May.

The pipeline was connected to Dominion Transmission Inc.’s interstate pipeline and will likely be connected to Texas Eastern Transmission’s pipeline at a later date. SAP Vice President of Development Ken Magyar said the project was designed to gather and connect wells to the interstate pipeline.

Businesses open, close

If I could go back a year, I would have started a list for this.

Fischer’s on the Diamond, Sowers Harvest Cafe and Poppy and Co. opened eateries. Speedy Furniture, Miska & Reini Goldsmiths and Jewelers and Anthym debuted as retailers.

Others like Mr. Tux, The Gamble Mill and Confer’s Country Market bowed out of business. They are some of the most difficult stories to do, especially the homegrown businesses.

Developer seeks permit for collegiate overlay project,"Borough Council is considering a conditional use permit following a presentation proposing a development in the collegiate housing overlay district.

Currently dubbed the “Rise,” the 12-story development seeks to provide commercial and residential space along the southwest corner of the intersection of East College Avenue and High Street. The development would overtake the two properties located at 532 and 538 E. College Ave. — The Colony Apartments and Kildare’s Irish Pub respectively.

CA Ventures submitted the application to request a conditional use permit, senior planner Anne Messner said. The proposal meets overlay conditions, which allow for a maximum building height of 124 feet.

Conditions include its location within the 500 block of East College Avenue, no ground-floor residential use and minimum lot area, she said.

The first two floors will be non-residential use, Messner said, with the remaining floors as residential. Professional and graduate residents are anticipated as the occupants of the first two floors of residential, with multifamily housing for students and inclusionary housing units as the remainder.

According to CA documents, the project would host 182 units with a total of 616 beds.

Inclusionary housing and a sculpted roof allow for an additional 10 feet of building height each, she said, adding an additional floor and a parapet wall and bringing the overall proposed building height to 140 feet. Eighteen units would be set aside as inclusionary housing.

CA Ventures Vice President of Design and Development Dan Hrankowsky said the top eight floors are considered “multifamily,” as CA Ventures has no plans on discriminating who wishes to occupy those floors. However, given the proximity of the building to campus, it very well may end up as student housing.

In addressing the ground floors, he said, it’s mandatory to have residential lobbies and meeting spaces within those non-residential spaces. The remaining area is a balance between service parking and commercial space, providing 100 percent of the required resident parking underground.

Potential retail tenants have already showed interest in the commercial spaces, he said. CA Ventures would be looking at a completion time around summer 2018.

Council showed concern with the idea of mixing families with children and students on the same floor. According to Messner, the inclusionary housing ordinance requires that these units not be clustered into a single location and interspersed throughout the project. However, it does not indicate the number of units on a particular floor.

President Jim Rosenberger said he liked that the project had accessible surface parking as well as underground parking, as well as a room for bicycle storage.

“What I’ve seen will catch people’s eyes coming into town,” he said.

According to borough solicitor Terry Williams, council has 45 days to render a decision regarding the application. Council may attach reasonable conditions to the decision in addition to those expressed in the ordinance.",Centre Daily Times
Developers buy Kildare’s pub property,"Prime real estate on the east side of downtown State College has been sold for $7.5 million to Chicago developers that could build an 11 story, 124-foot mixed-use building.

CA Student Living recently bought 538 E. College Ave. from Jeff Haas, who advocated for collegiate housing overlay projects to be developed on the 500 block of East College Avenue. The company specializes in investment, development and management in student housing.

The developers could reach the maximum height allowed — which was 65 feet until July 6 — if they design a building with commercial space on the first floor, two floors of mixed graduate and professional housing. They also would have to draw up sustainable features that meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards.

Haas said in an email he wanted to develop the property, but couldn’t pass up CA Student Living’s offer.

“It was always our intention to develop the property,” he said. “After the collegiate housing overlay was approved we were contacted by CA Student Living. (Due to) the combination of the financial opportunity and that CA shared our vision for a high quality multi-use building for the property we thought it was in our best interest and the best interest of the State College borough for continued downtown development of high quality, multi-use buildings ... to sell the property.”

Haas said he will not be a part of redevelopment of the property and will instead focus on expanding Team Blue, a hand car wash and detail company, through franchising. He founded the company with his son, Jason, in 2008.

“As a CEO and entrepreneur, I am always looking at opportunities,” Haas said. “I really enjoy making things happen.”

CA Student Living chief operating officer J.J. Smith, who is also listed as the company’s media contact, could not immediately be reached for comment.

The property is home to Kildare’s Irish Pub, which had a long-term lease with Haas. The pub’s general manager Lincoln Stuyvesant told the Centre Daily Times in January that if a new building were developed, they’d be invited into the first floor commercial by Haas. It is unclear if the restaurant is in CA Student Living’s plans.

Stuyvesant could not be reached for comment on Friday, and another manager declined comment.

State College Borough Council voted 6-1, with Sarah Klinetob casting the dissenting vote, in July to allow such projects.

Klinetob favored some incentives of possible collegiate housing overlay projects.

She said during council’s July 6 meeting, however, that she was deterred by a pending comprehensive rezoning and the Downtown Master Plan’s indication that the area was predominately students. She suggested that the core of downtown was more suitable for professionals.

Council president James Rosenberger and council member Evan Myers explained their support of such projects during the meeting.

Rosenberger said student density on the block would increase by a small fraction and that council would regret if it turned down the measure.

Myers questioned how the borough could preserve its neighborhoods, stay and pay its bills. He said the borough needed to be worried about its tax base, because council was struggling to balance the budget and needed to explore how to expand it.",Centre Daily Times
State College Borough Council OKs collegiate overlay,"The long-debated collegiate housing overlay proposal passed State College Borough Council Monday with a 6-1 vote in favor of the amendment.

The amendment was drafted in order to incentivize an increase in development capacity along the east end of downtown with discussion focused mainly on the lot containing Kildare’s Irish Pub at 538 E. College Ave.

Councilwoman Sarah Klinetob was the sole dissenting vote.

Under the proposal, several incentives would allow a developer to go beyond the current height maximum in exchange for certain amenities — additional floors of commercial space or environmental considerations would translate into additional stories of residential space.

While community input has been available at several previous council meetings, Mayor Elizabeth Goreham again opened the floor to public comment prior to the vote.

David Stone, a resident of East Foster Avenue, said there was a lost opportunity to bring the community together and develop a more positive vision for the community. Focusing the amendment on just one block sets a bad precedent, he said, adding that the issue should be revisited during a comprehensive rezoning plan.

Highlands Civic Association President Susan Venegoni also said the plan sets a bad precedent in its attempts to equate graduate students to professionals, a longstanding separation in residential housing that she called a “slippery slope.”

Her biggest concern, she said, was the pedestrian and traffic arrangements that still needed to be addressed.

“How much tax revenue is a life worth when people are running across that street?” she said.

Klinetob said that while a lot of good work had been done on the proposal, three points still concerned her — the upcoming comprehensive rezoning project, that the area predominantly consists of students, and that the core of downtown proposal is more highly suggested for professionals.

While she said she didn’t want to assume what the Planning Commission would prepare for the area during comprehensive rezoning, “I had at least enough doubt that this current proposal would not be the same or similar after a comprehensive rezoning effort, and believe that the staff resources proposed may be better directed at ensuring an enhanced professional zoning district in the core.”

Council President Jim Rosenberger said the council could tinker for another year changing small details of the plan, but ultimately, “perfect is the enemy of good.” Looking back four years, the council spent years of discussion and hundreds of thousands of dollars planning exactly what it wanted for the west end, and nothing has happened.

“Holmes-Foster neighborhood was saying what Highlands neighborhood is saying now,” he said. “Mainly, ‘No, no, no. We don’t want more density.’ And yet that proposal would have put density right at the border of town and gown, right where I think it should be.”

Councilman Peter Morris asked to compare the present zoning of the 500 block of East College with the overlay proposal, questioning which one comes closest to giving them what they want for the block.

“It’s clear to me that the overlay wins,” he said.

One of the things that’s not going to change is a downzoning of almost any block in the borough, he said, which would reduce commercial value of the property.

After the vote, council candidate Janet Engeman said if she were to add anything to what was said, it would be to ask how the borough plans to address construction of a new building without closing a portion of East College or High Street, likening it to the current partial closure of South Fraser Street during the construction of the Fraser Centre.

“This isn’t going to help the tax base that much,” Stone said. “It gets to be symbolic — high buildings mean progress, but when you look at it, it’s not going to do that. It’s an immense distraction, but we’re going to have to move on.”",Centre Daily Times
State College Borough Council likely to approve housing overlay,"Borough Council approved a motion to and gave notice of its intent to act on the controversial collegiate housing overlay proposal July 6.

The decision on the hotly debated topic comes after months of discussion dating back to 2014.

The overlay would have the potential to alter building heights and parking spaces, allowing for taller than normally allowed buildings under the current commercial zoning. Building heights could also be increased based on incentives for development, such as adding professional housing and underground parking.

Discussion has focused mainly on the Kildare’s Irish Pub property, located at 538 E. College Ave.

Resident Smita Bharti commented on the overlay, saying she started a change.org petition encouraging the council to vote “no” on the overlay. At press time, the petition had 116 signatures.

Bharti asked the council not to approve the overlay, saying it doesn’t yet know the impact the Metropolitan project will have on the borough before approving what could end up becoming a similar development.

Resident Al Drobka encouraged council members to approve the overlay, saying as buildings get older, this is an opportunity to incentivize development to build new, more energy-efficient buildings.

President Jim Rosenberger said he’s read the comments on Bharti’s petition, saying it’s important to consider the residents’ comments, but there are “a number of misconceptions.”

“For example, I have seen people put forward the idea that this will increase student density in the area,” he said. “Right now, if nothing happens, a seven-story student apartment building can be built in that spot.”

Mixed use buildings with commercial space included with residential tends to be a calming device in populated areas, he said. Leaving the zoning as is would remove those calming techniques.

Population is going to increase in State College, Councilwoman Theresa Lafer said, and the council can’t stop that. It instead becomes a question of where to put students.

“I’m 100 percent certain we can’t house them in the clouds,” she said, “so we have to house them in the borough and surrounding townships.”

Calling the people who own the property “evil developers” doesn’t make sense, she said. Council has evolved in thinking this was not a good idea regarding it as one of the best plans they’ve seen in a while, she said, and when it comes time to vote, she said she hoped council would vote in favor of it.

In other business, planner Meagan Tuttle updated council on the proposed Allen Street Civic District identified during the Planning Commission meeting Thursday.

The Planning Commission will be working with the redevelopment authority on certifying the district for redevelopment, she said. The district includes the properties between Highland Alley, West Foster Avenue, South Fraser Street and South Allen Street.

The commission is also working with Discovery Space to find office and storage space so the museum can remain in its current location during the redevelopment process, she said. It is also negotiating a lease with Penn State to remain as a tenant in the former Verizon Building during this period as well.",Centre Daily Times
State College Borough Council postpones vote on housing overlay,"Action on the proposed Collegiate Housing Overlay ordinance was again postponed Monday by Borough Council until the next voting meeting.

The decision to postpone came after two previous motions for action on the controversial amendment were not passed by the council.

Prior to the motions, council was given a presentation regarding assessed value and taxes paid by student apartments, a request by council members in previous discussions wishing to know the potential earning power of a housing project at 538 E. College Ave., the location of Kildare’s pub and restaurant.

According to Planning Director Ed LeClear, projected taxes and fees were based on a development that bears the most similarity to a project that could be seen at the Kildare’s site — the Legacy Apartments at 456 E. Beaver Ave.

The 75 units at Legacy bring in about $329,000 in taxes and fees, LeClear said, bringing about $75,000 in real estate taxes into the borough. As the parcel is currently zoned, a 30-unit apartment building could be constructed on the site, bringing about $32,000 in real estate taxes. Under the overlay with incentives, that could increase to 47 units, with about $66,000 in real estate taxes.

A full buildout using everything the overlay has to offer, he said, would see 61 units with about $80,000 in real estate taxes coming into the borough.

The Legacy Apartments saw 62 police calls in a one year period, he said. Assuming the overlay building would double that amount of calls, the police would see a 0.45 percent increase in crime, totallying about 67 hours of additional staff time.

Council President Jim Rosenberger’s motion to adopt the overlay ordinance as is died at the table.

Councilwoman Theresa Lafer said earlier that there was no way she could vote yes on an 11-story building, saying she would prefer to return the ordinance to the Planning Commission with recommendations to the commission.

Councilman Tom Daubert suggested that the section proposing an 11-story building be removed from the ordinance. A motion made to remove the conditional uses from the ordinance was voted down.

Property owner Jeff Haas spoke to council, saying he didn’t agree with removing the conditional uses from the ordinance, adding even if his building couldn’t get it done, it was immaterial.

“Give another developer the opportunity to use it,” he said, “and develop a nice building for downtown.”

The board unanimously agreed to postpone deliberation until the next voting meeting, slated for May 18.",Centre Daily Times
State College Borough Council hears feedback on housing overlay plan,"Borough Council has prolonged a decision regarding the hotly debated collegiate housing overlay proposal for at least another three weeks.

After a public hearing Monday, which saw a strong residential lean against the overlay, the council voted unanimously to schedule enactment or further review at its May 4 meeting, during which it could enact the proposal, reject it, send it back to the Planning Commission for further retooling or postpone action for a later meeting.

Planning Director Ed LeClear presented a rundown of the proposal’s history, from the first time it was brought to the board nearly a year ago to its current incarnation.

The overlay would allow for taller buildings to be constructed in the 500 block of East College Avenue through the use of developer incentives to create a more appealing structure for the residents of the building.

The first floor of the building would be required to be a commercial operation, according to the ordinance. Incentives, such as additional parking, graduate or professional housing and appealing building materials would allow for additional floors and wider floor space.

LeClear outlined the residential input the proposal has received, including emails, survey responses and a community Geodeliberations project.

Jeff Haas, who owns the property containing Kildare’s Irish Pub, said the proposal would allow for lot owners to develop attractive, environmentally friendly structures rather than letting the area deteriorate. This helps diversify the downtown population and attract more commercial tenants.

Highlands Civic Association President Susan Venegoni voiced her opposition to the proposal, saying the Highlands receives the highest number of citations than any other neighborhood.

“One thousand, seven hundred and nine units are being built or have been built in this area,” she said. “That’s 4,841 beds. There are also 9,000 rental permits in the borough. ... Do we really need more student housing?”

Borough resident David Stone said pedestrian and vehicle traffic issues haven’t been worked out yet, and a new building would likely not be affordable to students.

Planning Commission President Michael Roeckel spoke as a resident in support of the overlay, saying it was a chance to do something new in the borough.

“We put the plan together so we wouldn’t be getting any more undergrads than before,” he said. “Even with all the incentives and buildout, you’re still only getting seven stories of undergraduates.”

Councilman Evan Myers said it’s not an easy issue, especially, it seems, because few residents seem to know the future plans of Penn State. With no way of knowing how many students Penn State is planning on admitting, it’s difficult to determine how much housing is needed.

The council as a whole agreed that it needed more time to review all the resident correspondence in order to have an informed discussion and make the appropriate decision.",Centre Daily Times
State College Borough Council to hear public feedback on proposed Collegiate Overlay,"State College borough residents wishing to voice their concerns or support for the proposed collegiate housing overlay zoning ordinance amendment are encouraged to attend a public hearing regarding the overlay Monday.

In discussion between the Borough Council and the Planning Commission for the past several months, the overlay proposes adding housing incentives to the east end of East College Avenue, particularly the lot on which Kildare’s Irish Pub sits.

The overlay would have the potential to alter building heights and parking spaces, allowing for taller than normally allowed buildings under the current commercial zoning. Building heights could also be increased based on incentives for development, such as adding professional housing and underground parking.

Under the proposed overlay, buildings must provide a commercial space on the first floor in order to be eligible for maximum height and floor space, according to the ordinance. These maximums include a height of seven stories and a floor area ratio of four.

A floor area ratio, or FAR, controls the total development area of a property. On a 10,000-square-foot area, a FAR of four would allow for 4,000 square feet to be developed.

Several incentives are included with the ordinance, allowing a developer to go beyond the maximums in exchange for certain amenities. For example, an additional floor of commercial space would allow for an additional floor and one FAR, and a green building — one that follows certain energy and environmental designs — would gain an additional story, one FAR and a 20 percent parking reduction.

The Planning Commission has taken input from the property owners, public and staff since July, according to the borough website. The commission has since recommended the overlay for consideration by council.

The purpose of the ordinance, according to the council, is to “incentivize the development of buildings which achieve a greater community good.” This is accomplished in part by encouraging diverse residential construction, high-quality building design and in-building parking.

State College borough seeks input on overlay,"State College Borough Council is seeking resident input on a collegiate overlay plan proposed for the east end of East College Avenue.

A public hearing regarding the proposal has been scheduled for April 13.

The proposal would primarily affect 538 E. College Ave., the location of Kildare’s pub and restaurant. Under the current proposed ordinance , the overlay would allow for a multistory building with commercial space on the bottom and residential units above.

Under the proposed overlay, buildings must provide a commercial space on the first floor in order to be eligible for maximum height and floor space, according to the ordinance. These maximums include a height of seven stories and a floor area ratio of four.

A floor area ratio, or FAR, controls the total development area of a property. On a 10,000-square-foot area, an FAR of four would allow for 4,000 square feet to be developed.

Prior to the hearing, the borough is giving the public additional opportunity to comment on the proposal prior to the public hearing.

Through the borough’s website , residents have been asked, “Will the proposed collegiate housing overlay amendment, which has been recommended by the Planning Commission, achieve its intended purpose?” A group of borough residents participated in a Community Issue Review to develop claims that support, oppose and are neutral to this question, and are available for residents to review.

Student housing issue dominates State College planning discussion,"As the borough seeks input into its neighborhood and downtown master plans, concern still looms over the issue of student housing.

Planner Megan Tuttle presented neighborhood and downtown plan progress reports Monday to Borough Council, saying an implementation program is being developed that will tell the story of the projects being done collectively as a community.

The neighborhood plan itself contains 22 individual projects, programs or activities directly addressing 20 plan recommendations, Tuttle said. These projects involve several of the borough’s departments, authorities, boards and commissions.

The plan addresses three themes, she said — neighborhood facilities and appearance, balancing owner- and renter-occupied housing and neighbor-to-neighbor relationships. The goals of each are met through the different programs under each theme, such as neighborhood park improvement projects, evaluating the impacts of intermittent rentals on neighborhoods and researching best practices from peer communities.

The downtown master plan addresses four themes, she said: marketing the district, navigating the district, connecting the district and living in the district. Key programs under these themes include redesigning event logos, a downtown parking study, the capital improvements program and the plan’s influence on the proposed collegiate overlay zoning amendment.

Council members focused their questions on the issue of housing for young professionals, asking if finding a place for young professionals was part of the master plan.

According to Tuttle, the plan states that downtown will emerge as a place where professionals will want to live. Professional housing partnerships could develop through activities related to the downtown and neighborhood plans, and a young professionals group is working on networking activities about what opportunities might exist that the borough can suggest to other municipalities in the county.

Planner Ed LeClear said the Planning Commission has been wrestling with the difference between units to be rented and who would be living in the units.

In the case of the Metropolitan, a multistory apartment building going up along South Atherton Street, the top floors have been reserved for professional and graduate housing. LeClear said a lot of orientation has been placed on the number of bedrooms and the number of people occupying the rooms with the assumption that the market for professionals will require fewer bedrooms and lower occupancy.

Referring back to the proposed collegiate housing overlay, resident Janet Engeman said she thought community members weren’t sure they liked the idea of multistory buildings as far as Nittany Avenue and said the Downtown Improvement District was having a disproportionate influence on the community.

LeClear said the Planning Commission has spent the past seven months discussing what’s in the master plan as it relates to the eastern part of East College Avenue, including the proposed overlay.

“At the end of the day, the downtown plan is a guidance policy document,” he said, “but the details are something you spend a lot of time working with the public and the Planning Commission and eventually the council.”

The commission discussed the collegiate housing overlay during a meeting on Jan. 7.

The next step in the implementation of the plans is to collaborate with neighborhood organizations, student groups and community groups about projects they want to implement, Tuttle said.

A special meeting of the Planning Commission has been scheduled for 5 p.m. Thursday in the New Leaf Initiative office at the municipal building to discuss the neighborhood plan implementation program.",Centre Daily Times
State College Planning Commission considers collegiate housing overlay for east end,"The borough Planning Commission revisited the proposed collegiate housing overlay Wednesday with a text ordinance outlining the requirements and incentives that would be available within the zone on the east end of downtown.

The ordinance was drafted as three parts, planner Ed LeClear said, covering base requirements, incentives and conditional uses for the block facing East College Avenue between Hetzel Street and High Street.

“One of the overarching agreements that we’ve heard in terms of priorities is to get a well-designed building on that site,” LeClear said. “We have to push those design requirements and conditional use.”

Under the proposed overlay, buildings must provide a commercial space on the first floor in order to be eligible for maximum height and floor space, according to the ordinance. These maximums include a height of seven stories and a floor area ratio of four.

Floor area ratios, or FARs, control the total development area of a property. On a 10,000-square-foot area, an FAR of four would allow for 4,000 square feet to be developed.

Several incentives are included with the ordinance, allowing a developer to go beyond the maximums in exchange for certain amenities. For example, an additional floor of commercial space would allow for an additional floor and one FAR, and a green building — one that follows certain energy and environmental designs – would gain an additional story, one FAR and a 20 percent parking reduction.

With certain bonuses, the building could be constructed to 10 stories with a FAR of five and one parking reduction incentive.

Under conditional use, if three of four bonuses — a second floor of commercial space, a green building, underground parking and at least two levels of structured parking above ground — the building height raises to 11 stories with a FAR of six and two parking reduction incentives.

Non-owner occupied rental space can also increase to 11 stories with an additional FAR by dedicating two floors of the building to professional/graduate housing.

Jeff Haas, who owns the property leased by Kildare’s at 538 E. College Ave., opposed a portion of the ordinance dictating the number of bedrooms and the occupancy of certain rooms, saying markets change and the property owner should have the right to change spaces in the building based on demand.

He also opposed a stepback requirement, which stated that for every 45 feet of building height, it must step back from the curb a certain distance.

“You are absolutely destroying everything else that you've put together in the text amendment,” he said, “because you're shooting for a needle building and nobody's going to do it.”

A motion by Jon Eich requesting the removal of the stepback requirement was approved by the commission.

Eich also argued that if the owner must execute a covenant with the borough to assure continuation of amenities, why must they dictate the layout of the floors, saying, “Let the market dictate.”

The commission plans to revisit the ordinance at a future meeting.

Kildare’s general manager Lincoln Stuyvesant said the bar has a long-term lease with Haas and has been told they would be invited into the ground floor commercial space if a new building is developed.",Centre Daily Times
More discussion needed for State College development proposal,"A final decision on a proposed collegiate housing overlay for the east end of the borough is a long way off if Thursday’s Planning Commission discussions are any indication.

On Sept. 3, representatives of the owners of Kildare’s, at 538 E. College Ave., presented a text amendment for the overlay to the commission.

The overlay would have the potential to alter building heights and parking spaces, allowing for taller than normally allowed buildings under the current commercial zoning. Building heights could also be increased based on incentives for development, such as adding professional housing and underground parking.

A majority of the overlay would be dedicated to student housing.

Based on the dramatic proposals, the commission decided extensive discussions would be required to delve into all the potential effects the amendment would create. These discussions would be broken down by topic, such as building height, density, incentives and even if the area should be considered for the amendment.

Before discussions even began, Highlands resident Peg Hambrick suggested the board table the request, asking that if borough leaders plan on doing comprehensive rezoning, no overlays should be added until that is completed.

“I don’t think this request has a certain urgency,” Hambrick said. “We have an adequate supply of student housing in the region. Some might say we have far more than we need.”

Dave Stone, who lives on East Foster Avenue, said another reason the commission might want to consider tabling the proposal is due to potential traffic issues. Developing before addressing the traffic impact locks up land that could potentially be used to alleviate traffic issues, making those small slivers of land impossible to acquire by PennDOT.

The first issue raised by Chairman Michael Roeckel was if the area should be considered for the text amendment. Commissioner Jon Eich said since the proposal was presented, the commission has an obligation to review it.

Vice Chairwoman Anita Genger said the commission needs to be “very, very careful” with their consideration. She said she was disturbed with what happened with the Metropolitan, a 12-story building slated for construction on West College Avenue and South Atherton Street, where the developer took advantage of incentives, ending up with an “overly tall building where it is.”

In an straw poll, the commission agreed to continue with the discussion.

In a following issue, the commission asked if the amendment should permit higher density of residential uses. Most board members agreed an increase in density would be appropriate — within limits.

The main focus of discussion concerned the potential height of a development. Under recommendations made in the downtown master plan, the maximum height of a building would be 7 stories, or 74 to 86 feet.

According to Planning and Community Development Director Ed LeClear, the Kildare’s property represents a hole in the east end of downtown in terms of elevation change. The one-story structure is flanked on three sides by buildings that are nine stories, eight stories and seven stories.

Commissioner Zoe Boniface said the commission has to make practical considerations when it comes to height versus the footprint of a building. Most taller buildings in that section of downtown occupy large areas, whereas Kildare’s is on a single plot. This could potentially result in a very tall, very skinny highrise.

“How many elevator columns will fit in that?” she said. “How long will it take to evacuate? How do you configure underground parking when you need to use more available space for ramps?”

Ultimately, the board unanimously agreed on the recommendation made in the downtown master plan.",Centre Daily Times
Changes possible to East End of State College,"While one end of downtown State College is being prepped to hold a 12-story building, the other end could face big changes as well.

The borough’s Planning Commission recently heard a proposal from Alan Schlossberg, of Perkins Eastman Architects, and Jeff Haas, owner of Kildare’s Irish Pub at 538 E. College Ave.

The duo are proposing what they call the Collegiate Housing Overlay, an attempt to add housing incentives to the area. According to Schlossberg, the overlay would foster “development and activity in a way we hope will be beneficial to the borough and the development community.”

According to their presentation, the current commercial zoning promotes “low-quality housing designs.” But for the housing overlay, developers would be required to include high-quality designs, increased amenities and aesthetically pleasing building materials.

Schlossberg said developers could be more motivated to build better designs that include professional housing. That addition provides flexibility with building height, parking requirements and floor area ratios.

Floor area ratios, or FARs, control the total development area of a property. Schlossberg gave the example of owning a 10,000 square-foot area. With an FAR of 5, he would be allowed to develop 5,000 square feet of his property.

The maximum FAR in the current district is 3. According to Schlossberg, the maximum in the proposed overlay will be 6, of which 5 must be developed as residential. If a percentage of space is developed as professional housing, the FAR increases, leading to a maximum building height of eight stories, or 97 feet.

Under the overlay plan, developers also would have flexibility with parking regulations to create wider sidewalks, underground parking and indoor bicycle parking.

Chairman Michael Roeckel said no vote would be taken on the proposal without further consideration and public input.",Centre Daily Times

In order for the incentive to qualify for the bonuses, the incentive shall meet or exceed the criteria described below. (Each parcel shall be eligible to earn one or more bonuses, not to exceed the maximum building height and stories identified in Section 1812.c): Table 1 (i.)Description of Incentives. All of the incentives listed in Table 1 above are described in detail below. In order for the incentive to qualify for a bonus, the incentive shall meet or exceed the criteria described below. 

(1) Indoor Protected Bicycle Parking. Indoor protected bicycle parking spaces are secure facilities that protect the entire bike against theft and against inclement weather. These facilities include but are not limited to bike lockers, check-in facilities, monitored bike parking, restricted access parking and personal storage. To qualify for this bonus, applicant must provide at least the minimum required spaces per section 1811.f, and 75% of these spaces must be provided in a protected facility. These spaces must be clearly distinguishable, and described on a site plan, from other required bike parking, which may be in the form of exterior racks/storage areas. The bicycle parking cannot be provided within the units. 

(2) Above Ground Floor Commercial. Any building achieving more than one floor dedicated to non-residential use, will be eligible for one additional floor of height to provide an additional story of commercial use. Only one additional story of height can be achieved using this bonus, with a maximum of 14 feet for the story. The total permitted height of the first floor, plus an additional floor of non-residential cannot exceed 34 feet. 

(3) Green Certified. 

(a) Any building designed andconstructed following the currently applicable Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System.This includes major renovations to existing buildings as defined in the applicable LEED Green Building Rating System.To qualify for this bonus, a building must obtain the minimum number of points through the LEED certification process to receive designation as a Silver Certified Building or higher (or equivalent level of certification.) 

(b) Any application for a bonus to increase building height through the green certified incentive must include a LEED Project Checklist for New Construction and Major Renovations, or successor checklist that identifies those credits that will be utilized to obtain the required LEED certification. 

(c) Any applicant that intends to obtain a bonus allowing increased building height must post a performance bond with the Borough of State College as surety that the building will receive the appropriate level of LEED certification or higher. State College Borough Council shall establish the amount of this performance bond by Resolution. State College Borough will deposit this bond in an Environmental Sustainability Improvement Fund. 

(d) Conditional occupancy maybe granted prior to receipt of documentation from the US Green Building Council (USGBC) or a USGBC certified professional that the Silver or higher LEED certification has been awarded if a USGBC certified professional reviews the completed construction and notifies the Planning Department the building has been constructed based on the submitted application to USGBC. 

(e) Upon Receipt of Documentation from the US Green Building Council (USGBC) or a USGBC certified professional that the appropriate level of LEED certification has been awarded to the applicant, State College Borough will return the bond, with any accrued interest, to the applicant. Failure to obtain the appropriate level of LEED certification within a period of one year from the date of the issuance of the certification of occupancy will result in forfeiture of the performance bond and accrued interest. The applicant may request the Borough Manager or his/her designee extend this certification period for a period of not to exceed 2 years. Said extension must include documentation that all materials necessary to obtain certification have been submitted to USGBC. State College Borough shall use any forfeited performance bond funds on projects to increase the environmental sustainability of community facilities in State College Borough. 

(4) Underground Parking. Parking located at street level reduces opportunities to utilize this valuable space for activities that increase street life. Locating parking in subsurface facilities expands the total building volume available for commercial and residential development. To qualify for the bonus, a minimum of 65% of the total project parking must be provided in subsurface facilities. (5) Structured Parking within a building footprint. Parking located at street level reduces opportunities to utilize this valuable space for activities that increase street life. Locating parking in structured facilities expands the total building volume available for commercial and residential development. However, site constraints and geology may interrupt the ability to develop subsurface parking.To qualify for the bonus, at least two levels of parking must be provided above the ground level within the footprint of the primary development. For each two levels of parking in an above ground structure, an additional one story of residential or commercial uses may be developed. (6) Owner-Occupied Housing. Owner-occupied residential refers to dwelling units that are a residence of the legal or beneficial owner. Any project pursuing designation as an owner-occupied residential project must establish a home-owners or condominium association and incorporate appropriate provisions in its association by-laws to insure that the use of the property is for owner occupied dwellings, including limitations on leasing units. The by-laws of the home-owners or condominium association shall grant the authority for enforcing the owner-occupied covenant to the Borough of State College. Changes to the by-laws that will affect the occupancy covenant must be approved by the Borough of State College. Legal costs accrued as a result of a conflict in an occupancy covenant must be borne by the home-owners or condominium association.To qualify for this bonus, 100% of the residential units proposed must be designated and used as owner occupied and include a covenant to ensure this use.",Ordinance
Section 1813. Collegiate Housing Overlay Projects as a Conditional Use,"a. Purpose. The purpose and intent of the Collegiate Housing Overlay Project as a Conditional Use is to expand upon the overlay and the incentives/bonus table in the Collegiate housing Overlay by allowing for additional development capacity through the conditional use process. The conditional use requiring projects to require building façade enhancements, aesthetically pleasing materials, high-quality building design and increased tenant diversity. 

In order to qualify for the conditional use both the overlay and the incentives/bonuses must be followed as prescribed in Sections 1811 and 1812. In order to qualify for the conditional use, a minimum residential FAR of 5 must be achieved and the maximum stories in Section 1813.d. 

b. Use. Land and buildings used for a collegiate housing overlay project as a conditional use shall meet the following criteria: 

	(1) Buildings used as churches or places of religious worship or instruction are exempt from this requirement. 

		(i) Residential uses not exceeding the permitted FAR for residential, includingprofessional/graduate housingbonuses. 

	(2) The following restrictions apply to all ground floor areas in buildings located within the Collegiate Housing Overlay: 

		(i) Residential uses of any type are prohibited. 
		
		(ii) At least the first 25 feet of a building's depth with street frontage shall be occupied by a use other than parking or residential that is otherwise a permitted use in the zoning district at that location. 

		(iii) Pedestrian access to parking areas are allowed in this 25-foot area. Vehicular access is prohibited in this 25-foot area. 

	(3) At least 50% of the commercial space's exterior street frontage shall be devoted to windows affording view by passersby into the interior commercial space. 

c.Standards and Criteria. The following standards apply to Collegiate Housing Overlay Project as a Conditional Use: 

	(1) Minimum Lot Area. (Square Feet). ................ 15,000 

	(2) Minimum Lot Width. (On All Frontages) .......... 90 feet 

	(3) Front Yard Depth (On All Frontages) .......... same as underlying zoning 

	(4) Side and rear yards shall comply with the underlying zoning in the Commercial District. 

	(5) Ground Floor Commercial. Ground floor commercial space required.

d.Maximum Allowance using the Incentives/Bonus Schedule. Each parcel shall be eligible to earn additional development capacity by utilizing the Conditional Use process, but may not exceed the maximum building height, stories, residential FAR and parking reduction identified below: 

	(1) Maximum building height ........................ 120 feet 

	(2) Maximum building stories ........................ 10 stories only when Section 1813.(k)Collegiate Housing - Professional Housingis followed but only one floor of such residential use is achieved in the building. 

	(3) Maximum building stories ........................ 11 stories only when Section 1813.(k)Collegiate Housing - Professional Housingis followed and two floors of such residential use is achieved in the building. Maximum of one story for each floor permitted. 

	(4) Maximum Residential FAR ..................... 7 only when 2 floors of Section 1813.(k)Collegiate Housing - Professional Housingis followed. Maximum of one FAR increase for each floor permitted up to a total increase of two FAR. 

	(5) Maximum parking reduction ....................... Two additional parking reductions can be selected as part of the Collegiate Housing Overlay Projects after the one incentive selected from Table 1812.d is calculated as part of Section 1812. 

	(6) Maximum development permitted as part of the conditional use process can be increased to 124 feet and 11 stories if the following conditions are followed: 

		(i) All parts of the conditional use process are met. 

		ii) When two floors of commercial use are provided as described in the Table 1 in Section 1812 and two floors of the professional/graduate units are also provided. 

e.Building Facade Offsets. Long continuous walls in the same plane and blank walls void of architectural form and detail are undesirable along street-facing facade walls. Street-facing facade walls designed to produce shadow lines and visual relief through offsets, projections, changes in texture and materials, use of recesses including windows and doorways, canopies, and/or other architectural features are desirable. Differential between the ground floor walls at street level and the walls on floors above is also desirable. Accordingly, the following visual interest standards shall apply to all walls facing public streets in the Collegiate Housing Overlay: 

	(a) No portion of a building's wall with street frontage shall exceed 50 feet in continuous horizontal length in the same plane. The face of such wall shall be staggered or offset to provide wall segments that project forward and/or backward in order to break the plane by forming recesses, projections, and/or other displacements. Either (a)(i) and (a)(ii) below may be selected. 

		(i) The minimum displacement required between segments is 1 foot. Such offsets may be staggered across individual stories or may be aligned vertically from floor to floor on walls facing the street. In either design, the total horizontal line of the offsets per story shall equal at least 25% of the total horizontal wall length facing the street and shall extend vertically for the whole wall height of that story. Offsets or wall segments may be summed to meet the 25% requirement. No offset is required on walls facing alleys or yards not abutted by street lines. 

		(ii) The displacement required between segments may be achieved by utilizing solid and glazed materials in building facade finishes. Such offsets may be staggered across individual stories or may be aligned vertically from floor to floor on walls facing the street. In either design, the total horizontal line of offsets, per story, shall be distributed along the horizontal wall length(s) facing the street and shall extend vertically for the whole wall height of that story. This offset is required on all visible building facades facing streets, alleys and access easements 

	(b) In addition to offsets, the ground floor of all nonresidential facades facing public streets shall have a separate architectural treatment distinguishing it from the floor immediately above by using architectural features that create visual interest and shadow lines. These features may include elements such as arcades, display windows, recessed or projected entry areas, projecting awnings, canopies, and projecting overhangs. The cumulative length of these features shall equal or exceed 50% of the building's horizontal facade length at street level. These features may be used individually or in any combination that distinguishes the ground floor from the floor above. In some cases variations may extend beyond ground floor and distinguish the higher floors where there is the same desired architecture of the lower floor. 

	(c) Borough Council, following review by the Design Review Board and Planning Commission, may accept an alternative facade design per Section 1810 d.(8)(a)(i) or (a)(ii) and (b) for residential and mixed use buildings. 

f.Corner Expression Guidelines. 

	(a) Corner conditions that offer no opportunities for pedestrian activity and are void of architectural form are undesirable. It is desirable to promote a node for pedestrian activity through high-quality architectural design at corners. Accordingly, parcels located on corners in the Collegiate Housing Overlay are subject to corner expression guidelines. The area regulated by these guidelines is defined as the following: 

		(i) An isosceles triangle formed by the two intersecting front setback lines parallel to the curb face. The triangle has two equal sides of 20 feet, starting at the vertex of the setback lines, and measured outward. 

		(ii) Corners formed by East Calder Way are exempt from these guidelines. 

	(b) Buildings which fall into this defined area shall have the following visual interest standards: 

		(i) Any architectural overhangs occurring above the ground floor must be at least 13 feet above grade in the designated area. 

		(ii) A maximum of 20% of the gross area on the ground floor in the defined area shall be interior space. 

		(iii) At least one entrance to the building must occur within, or directly adjacent to, the defined area at street level. 

		(iv) The cumulative length of architectural features listed in Section 1810.c (8)(b) shall equal or exceed 80% of the building’s horizontal façade length within the defined area up to a height of 45 feet above street level. 

g.Building Materials. Use of vinyl siding and untextured concrete block or other untextured veneers is prohibited.

Ground floor commercial up to and including the fourth floor that fronts on a street shall not be permitted to contain synthetic stucco. The remaining floors facing the street shall not exceed 50 percent coverage of synthetic stucco. The use of synthetic stucco on the remaining floors facing alleys and yards is permitted. 

h.Parking. Collegiate housing overlay projects must comply with the parking requirements of the zoning district in Section 1807, except as provided below: 

i.Off-site Parking Standards. 

	(1) Parking provided in an off-site facility must be within 400 feet of the use served and is under control of the property or has entered into a 99 year lease arrangement for use of the parking spaces. 

	(2) The 400-foot requirement does not apply to valet parking that is established with an agreement in place for a minimum of 29 years that shall be renewable in perpetuity. 

j.Fee-In Lieu Parking. 

	(1) New residential construction is eligible for fee-in-lieu parking after the incentive /bonus table parking reductions as noted in Section 1813.d are applied, provided that: 

		i. Lot size and location restricts ability to comply with parking requirements of this section, up to 30 percent of the required parking may be provided as fee-in-lieu provided that the remaining 70 percent of the required parking is located on the same lot as the residential use served by the parking. 

		ii. Not more than 6 off-street parking spaces may be provided through the fee-in-lieu-of special exception for existing buildings, or portions of existing buildings, which are reused for residential purposes. 

		iii. That the fee-in-lieu requested is not contrary to the public interest (i.e. will not: (i) increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger public safety; (ii) increase traffic congestion; or (iii) be contrary to the harmony, spirit and purpose of this ordinance.) 

		iv. No zoning permit shall be issued until plans are submitted and approved showing the provision of the parking required for such construction by the terms of the Zoning Ordinance. 

		v. In-lieu payments shall be paid in full, in cash or cash equivalent, and no zoning permit shall be issued until the landowner or his agent has deposited such payments in full. 

		vi. Borough Council shall establish by Resolution the amount of the in-lieu fee per parking space omitted. The amount of the in-lieu fee may be changed from time to time by Council, based on the Borough's most recent experience in the cost of providing on-lot parking spaces in a parking structure, or other generally accepted standards in the construction industry. 

		vii. Special Conditions: 

			a. All in-lieu fees paid by landowners shall be accounted for in a separate fund. Funds shall be used exclusively for: 

				1) providing additional parking facilities in the C, CID, R-0, and UV zoning districts; 

				2) parking facility renovations that result in a net gain of parking spaces 

				3) satellite parking facilities 

				4) transit facility improvements including but not limited to signage and transit stop amenities within 1,000 feet of the development site 

				5) pedestrian improvements related to parking facilities 

				6) non-routine capital repairs, expansion and/or maintenance of existing parking facilities 

				7) acquire land for use as a parking facility in the C, CID, R-0, and UV zoning districts 

				8) Reimbursing the costs of any parking facility in the C, CID, R-0, and UV zoning districts that is under construction or has been completed within one calendar year from the date when the in- lieu payment is received by the Borough. Such lots or facilities may be constructed by the Borough and need not be within reasonable walking distance of properties for which payments have been made, except in accordance with a phased plan. 

			b. It is further the intention of this ordinance that the planned, shared public parking facilities may provide for parking needs in a more efficient manner, resulting in fewer total parking spaces than would be required if provided on-lot by each landowner, so that the public parking spaces provided by such Borough need not necessarily equal those for which in- lieu payments have been made. 

			c. All in-lieu fees collected must be expended or committed to be expended for the provision of additional public parking facilities within 7 years of receipt of the in-lieu payment required. If said payments have not been expended or committed to be expended, the amount of such in-lieu payment, plus interest actually accumulated thereon, shall be refunded to the then- owner of the property for which the in-lieu payment was made, whether such owners are the original payor or a successor owner. The term ""expended"" or ""committed to be expended"" shall be deemed to include, but not limited to, the use of such funds for: construction, or for the purchase of land, the execution of a contract for construction or purchase, official action required for taking land by Eminent Domain, or by expenditure or obligation to pay for engineering, architecture, or other planning expenses. 

				1) In-lieu payments shall be paid in full, in cash or cash equivalent, and no zoning permit shall be issued until the landowner or his or her agent has deposited such payments in full with the Borough. 

				2) If any refunds of in-lieu payments are made after the expiration of the times stated in (c), then such properties for which in-lieu payments were refunded shall be considered lawful non-conforming uses or structures insofar as the required parking was not provided on- lot or in a public facility.",Ordinance
Section 1814. Covenants with the Borough for Bonuses,"a. Purpose. To assure continuation of amenities, housing or uses provided in a project to qualify for bonuses, the property owner must execute a covenant with the Borough of State College. The covenant is required prior to issuance of the building's occupancy permit and is made in consideration of allowing additional building stories or increased floor area above the base zoning or a reduction in required parking based on the incentive/bonus zoning scheme under Section 18XX. 

b. Requirements. The covenant must run with the land and be attached to the land. In the event the property owner fails to abide by the covenant, the Borough shall be empowered to terminate occupancy of the units associated with the additional building stories or increased floor area and are identified in the covenant and to obtain injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining future occupancy of the building while the violation of the covenant occurs. All covenants must be approved in form by the Borough solicitor and be recorded with the Centre County Recorder of Deeds and referenced on the development plan. Covenants shall be recorded prior to building occupancy and shall specify that the landowner will comply with all approval conditions applicable to the incentive and bonus provisions under which the land development plan was approved.",Ordinance
Section 1815. Termination and Modification of Collegiate Housing Overlay Projects as a Conditional Use,"a. Termination of a Conditional Use Permit. When the conditional use permit is authorized by Council, continuation of such use shall be dependent upon meeting the expressed terms of the permit and the ordinance. In the event of non-compliance, the conditional use permit shall be suspended until such time the use is again compliant. 

b. Modification and Transfer of the Conditional Use Permit. The conditional use permit may be modified only by action of the Municipal Council subject to a new public hearing and review. Transfer of the permit to a new owner or operator is allowed without hearing and shall not constitute modification provided that compliance is maintained with the terms of the original approval.",Ordinance

The purpose of the ordinance is to incentivize the development of buildings which achieve a greater community good.It is observed that multi-family, student-oriented housing development has a strong market in our community.The ordinance was drafted to build upon this market by incentivizing an increase in development capacity in order to achieve the following goals: 

Goals: 

	laim-in-post""Encourage new residential construction which includes a diversity of unit sizes and types with an emphasis on units which meet the needs of and will be marketed to a wider audience of potential residents, particularly graduate students and professionals. 

	Incentivize LEED certified construction. 

	Encourage high-quality building design, the use of durable and attractive building materials, and pedestrian-oriented building frontages on the ground floor of buildings. 

The ordinance encourages new residential construction by increasing residential FAR 3.0 to 4.0 for projects that incorporate commercial uses on the first floor. In addition, the ordinance offers incentives to increase residential density even further--up to 5.0 FAR--by incorporating green building design or by designating a portion of the residential units as owner occupied. A conditional use process incorporated in the ordinance will allow projects meeting specific spatial requirements (minimum 15,000 square foot lot size, minimum 90 foot lot width on all frontages) to further develop to a residential FAR of 7.0 if they incorporate architectural details that enhance pedestrian activity, use high quality exterior building materials, or designate a portion of the residential units for professional housing. 

Provide ground floor commercial space in a part of downtown where it is not currently required and further incentive the provision of additional commercial space. 

The ordinance requires first floor commercial uses to enhance the streetscape and provide a pedestrian-oriented focus. The first floor commercial requirements in the ordinance also offer opportunities for a range of student amenities on-site to enhance walkability in this area. Additional residential incentives are provided for projects that include commercial development above the ground floor. Streetscape improvements and a study of traffic patterns will be needed to further address connections from this site to adjacent uses. 

Reduce vehicular parking requirements, through incentives, to a rate that is appropriate for development in a walkable, transit-accessible downtown environment. Encourage the development of that parking in structures that will reduce the amount of valuable land area dedicated to surface parking. 

The proposed Collegiate Overlay District supports alternate transportation modes (walking, bicycling) by requiring on-site bicycle parking and by allowing a reduction in vehicle parking if indoor bicycle parking and other bicycle amenities are provided.For projects that provide indoor, protected parking for bicycles, a 10% reduction in required vehicle parking is offered. Parking can be further reduced for projects with designated owner-occupied residential units or for projects that provide underground or structured parking. The ordinance encourages a compact, walkable development pattern that incorporates first floor commercial uses. This reduces the overall need for parking spaces and minimizes the inefficient use of land for surface parking lots. 

Balance the desire for building amenities which are believed to have a positive impact on the community with the realities of the residential housing market, financing, and building design and construction challenges. 

The Collegiate Overlay District provides developers with opportunities to maximize their property values, address current residential market demands, and offset financial costs of residential development in the downtown by providing residential density incentives such as first floor commercial, green building design, reduced parking requirements, and bicycle amenities designed to benefit the overall health and diversity of the community.",Subject Matter Expert Statement: SUBSTANTIATE
Summary,"In my opinion the Collegiate Overlay District incentivizes development opportunities in the downtown and takes advantage of the existing student-oriented market. It encourages the highest and most efficient use of a limited land resource, and supports recommendations from the Downtown State College Master Plan to add value to the community overall. 

I believe the proposed Collegiate Overlay District represents a first step in implementing the recommendations in the Downtown State College Master Plan for a ""East End Collegiate District,"" at the intersection of High Street and East College Avenue. The Master Plan recommends this location for additional student housing development in exchange for high quality design and other incentives. 

The Downtown Master Plan notes that student housing development in the downtown may remove some of the pressure for rental conversions in the Borough's stable, single-family neighborhoods. Not specifically mentioned in the Downtown Plan, but another benefit of student housing downtown is the potential to relieve pressure on the finite resources of the community's public transit system. The close proximity of students to campus and downtown amenities means a higher likelihood that walking and bicycling will be preferred modes of transportation. 

The proposed Collegiate Overlay District is consistent with the recommendations of the Downtown State College Master Plan and with the goals and policies of the Centre Region Comprehensive Plan by encouraging a dense development pattern within the designated Regional Growth Boundary, where infrastructure such as sewer, water and transportation, and community services such fire, police and transit are already in place.

In conclusion, I believethe proposed ordinance will open new development opportunities in the downtown primarily by allowing for greater residential density in exchange for community-oriented incentives such as first floor commercial uses, bicycle amenities, and good building design.",Subject Matter Expert Statement: SUBSTANTIATE
Interview Video and Transcript,"Subject Matter Expert: Substantiate 

This recording is of the substantiate subject matter expert's position statement. And, first I'm going to start out by asking you to introduce yourself. 

Sure, my name is D.J Liggett. I'm a senior planner with the Centre Regional Planning Agency. 

Great, and could you start out by telling us a little bit about some of the background materials that you used to familiarize yourself with this issue. 

Absolutely, for me this issue goes back quite a ways to the overall regional comprehensive plan that was done by all of the center region municipalities. It was initiated back in about 2010 and it was completed in 2013, and that comprehensive plan looked at the community holistically and identified growth boundary areas and preservation areas, and that led to a future land-use map for the region. The future land-use map identifies what kinds of land uses you want to see and where those land uses would be. In the Borough of State College, for obvious reasons, because it's an employment center, because the university is there, because there is a pour-down of town there, the Borough is identified as a higher density land-use area. Out of that future land-use map, and with other planning initiatives in the Borough, the Borough began a downtown master plan process, looking at what can be done in the downtown area. 

One of the suggestions that came out of that downtown master plan had to do with the east end of the downtown of the Borough, and identified specifically what they called an ""east-end collegiate district"". So the ordinance that has been developed by the Borough Planning Commission at this point mirrors a lot of the recommendations that came out of that downtown master plan. So if you consider the premise that higher density development makes sense in the Borough of State College, and you try to incentivize how you get that higher density development to occur, you start looking at an ordinance that will provide some trade-offs to a developer who may find development in the Borough of State College a little bit more expensive. Land is a little higher priced, the infrastructure is already in place, so you're not paying for those sorts of things, but you're paying for that cost of the land. So ordinances in the development of the Borough may tend to be a little more expensive and little more difficult for developers. 

One way to encourage developers to build in the Borough would be to allow them to increase density, and, as I said, the Borough is an area that has been identified as appropriate for higher-density, for a variety of reasons that I mentioned as well- the proximity to the university, the proximity to employment. So the ordinance that is under consideration right now, the Collegiate Overlay District Ordinance- it identifies as an incentive or as a bonus to the developers, the ability to increase residential density. And it's described in terms of FAR, which is a difficult concept for people to understand, but FAR basically represents floor-area ratio. And when they say they're increasing FAR from three (3) to four (4), essentially what that means is the floor-area ratio for your building is 1000 sq. ft. A FAR of three (3) means that you can have 3000 sq. ft. of residential development. If you increase that to four (4) now you can have 4000 sq. ft. of residential development. So as you increase that number, you're increasing actually as stories of a building- you add another story of residential development; it's kind of like that concept. 

So the carrot for developers to develop in the Borough would be to allow them to build higher residential density. That’s attractive to the Borough because there are a lot of student housing projects in the Borough already, there are a lot of students living in the Borough. Some of them are scattered in Borough neighborhoods living in rental conversion properties as opposed to being closer to the downtown or in campus. So identifying the east end as a location for higher student housing makes a lot of sense because it's directly across the street from Penn State University. There are a lot of student housing projects in that area already, and so this is an area that was targeted for higher residential development and specifically geared toward students. 

The density incentive is then offset by the things that the community values in terms of this development. Some of the things that the Borough has identified in the way of community values are first floor commercial use. So in this ordinance you're required to put in first floor commercial. That's a benefit because it enhances the walkability of the downtown, it provides for amenities that are within walking or bicycling distance. 

A further benefit of having more walkability is you're finite resources that are devoted to the public transit system can now be offered to Houserville or places like Boalsburg instead of providing intense transit service to some of these student housing projects that are located outside of easy walking distance. You can provide them to folks so that they can find an affordable place to live; a single family house and an affordable place to live. So you're spreading your transit services a little more generally around the community as opposed to providing intense level of transit service to one student housing unit, so student housing in the Borough enables bicycling and walking. 

Another community value that's incorporated into the ordinance is reduction of parking. A surface parking lot is not as attractive to walk past as a commercial development or something that has some appeal to pedestrians walking by. And a surface parking is not going to provide the same kind of tax revenues to the Borough as a higher-rise building will provide there. So by allowing a reduction in parking, increasing the amount of bicycling parking that's provided as part of the building- that's another benefit that the Borough will gather from offering the incentive of higher residential development. 

The other incentive or trade-off that the Borough is requesting as a result of higher density development is higher attention to the building materials and in the buildings that are being built. So requirements for Lead certification or green-building design are incorporated into this ordinance. The outdoor building materials and the presence of the building on the street has to be of higher level in order to make it an attractive facility. So all of those community values are then provided in exchange for the developer getting a higher amount of residential development. Another provision in the ordinance, at this point, is to encourage a variety of housing types within the building so that it's all not devoted to student housing, there might be some young professional housing, there might be some graduate student housing in the building as well- so there are incentives built into the ordinance to encourage developers to address that particular need for housing in the downtown as well. 

So in a nutshell, as I said, if you believe that it's important to concentrate higher density development within the core area of the community, which I would identify as the Borough of State College, if you recognize that the development within the Borough is perhaps more expensive or more difficult for developers, then you can understand that it makes sense to offer developers an incentive in the way of a residential density bonus, where, again, it makes sense to have residential density. And then in exchange for that, request that the developer provide things like onsite bicycle parking, first floor commercial uses, a building that's Lead certified or a green building, and other amenities that will be helpful to the community in that location downtown. 

Thank you. Is there anything else about your position on this issue that you'd like to share? 

No I think that sums it up. 

Excellent, well thank you very much for your time. 

Thank you.",Subject Matter Expert Statement: SUBSTANTIATE
Introduction,"Prepared by:

State College, PA 16803 

Dear Ms. Tuttle, 

I begin for thanking you for your time and consideration in including members of the community with a role in the review process of the subject ordinance draft. I feel it necessary to define my participation as that of an individual member of the community unaffiliated with my role as President of Keystone Real Estate Group, its owners, customers or employees. My comments are personal and do not reflect the opinions of any professional relationship. 

I believe in Zoning Regulations. Zoning ordinances, when scripted properly, provide clear guidelines to enhance public safety, protect property value and generally organize the utilization of land in an appropriate manner.I do not believe they are intended to be tools for the restriction of a property owner’s inherent property ownership rights. I will describe below why and how I feel this draft ordinance has failed in its purpose, which is vague and subjective.",Subject Matter Expert Statement: REFUTE
Review Commentary/Opinion,"First, the purpose of the ordinance states: The purpose of the ordinance is to incentivize the development of buildings which achieve a “greater community good.” 
	
	What is the definition of “greater community good”? 

	Who defined it? 

	Can it be quantified and measured to ensure it has been achieved? 

I suggest that if the “greater community good” includes public safety, protect property value or generally organize the utilization of land, it has not achieved any one effect. 

	Public Safety – The proposed ordinance geographic land area is located in an area of the borough that is highly underequipped with infrastructure.Creating such high density real estate (incentives all drive FAR) in an area that does not have: 

		Traffic signalization or crosswalks for pedestrian access (incentives promote reduced onsite parking and/or utilization of remote parking, which drives pedestrian traffic). 

		Dedicated bike paths for cyclists (incentives provided by encouraging bike racks). 

		Sight lines for vehicular traffic with setbacks of buildings roughly 10‐15 feet from a state roadway and directly adjacent to on street parking. 

		Supporting feeder/access road networks beyond Calder Alley, which is already a dangerous and heavily utilized traffic path for motorists and pedestrians who use it as a shortcut to avoid College and Beaver Avenues. 

		Peak pedestrian and vehicular infrastructure support. I urge the planners and/or committee to travel the routes of East College, East Beaver and East Calder during move in or move out weekends now, before an increase in density of residential development. Route 26 is limited to one lane of traffic in the easterly direction as a necessity to serve only the Meridian. The logistics of peak volume support are unachievable with increased density. 

	Protection of Property Value –The proposed ordinance creates a density closer to the east end residential district that has shown their distaste for all things pro‐growth.The geographic area is small restricting and creating a hub development available to few property owners who will now compete with the land that has equal or greater development potential of the larger commercial district. The people who purchased and developed land on blocks adjacent and did so at a premium with respect to development potential are now negatively impacted by an increased supply of land with comparable and greater use. 

	Generally Organized – While the amendment does organize uses into what are potentially appropriate categories, the land area is so small it appears to me to be a “spot zoning” hoping to promote the development potential of a minority. 

Second,the ordinance does not contain definitions associated with a broad range of terms that are the basis of incentives(Examples:Graduate Student and Professional). Who monitors these and to what standard? 

Third, the ordinance creates and promotes the undocumented occupancy with “Owner‐Occupied” incentives (Section 1812 d, i., 6). In what way could the ordinance restrict a parent from occupying the property with their son or daughter and allowing their friends (up to 5 unrelated) from staying with them “rent free”? Is that allowable? Who monitors how often the parent lives there? What if they work out of town? What if they have it as a second home? 

Fourth,the ordinance lacks measurable restrictions(Example:Section 1813, 2, iii – Pedestrian Access). The ordinance defines pedestrian access as an allowable use on the commercial level. How much of the lower level can be defined as pedestrian access? Does an ATM or laundry count as commercial use with 90% of the first level defined as pedestrian access? Has that promoted and achieved the commercial development of “the greater good”? 

Fifth,Section 1813contains subjective opinions of design. How did 50’ of continuous wall and/or 1’ of setback become “desirable” as state in Section f? Who defines the utilization of isosceles as “desirable”? What standard of architecture, engineering or art was utilized? The material restrictions of Section g are similar. Who decides what looks “nice enough for the greater good”? 

Sixth,Section 1813, h, i, 1 contains a standard for parking within 400’ of the property. How was that chosen? What land area within 400’ exists that is likely to be redeveloped for this use? 

Seventh,Section 1813, j, 1, vii., allows for utilization of fee in lieu for offsite parking. It does not contain a distance requirement for utilization of the funds. Spending funds on a parking garage 5 miles from the existing would not, in my opinion, be supportive of the intent and is left at the discretion of the borough. Section 6 allows for expenditures to be made on capital improvements of existing facilities that don’t serve the district. 

Eighth,Section 1813, j, 1, b defines public parking being developed in a more “efficient” manner. What is that metric? How is it measured? 

Ninth,Section 1813, j, 1, k, a, vi creates the requirement of a “full time manager”. What does that mean (24‐Hour Onsite, Regular Business Hours Onsite)? It also includes mitigating efforts such as cameras. What standard of design and coverage applies and is acceptable?",Subject Matter Expert Statement: REFUTE
Conclusion,"I am certain that the comments I have made above will be taken a critical. That is not my intent. Rather, the intent was to identify areas of the draft that have, in my opinion, failed to achieve the intent of the ordinance. I believe I have done so in this writing. I find the entire premise of the ordinance to be baseless with a purpose that does not provide a measurable metric of success or failure in purpose. I find the purpose of the ordinance itself to be an assemblage of superficial restrictions of a property owner’s right to develop and utilize methods found to be “undesirable” by a limited few. The entire ordinance is a failure of ours on behalf of our forefathers who wrote: 

“(t)he true foundation of a republican government is the equal right of every citizen in his person and property and in their management” – Thomas Jefferson",Subject Matter Expert Statement: REFUTE
Interview Video and Transcript (1),"So I just wanted to follow up and ask for clarification that you may have been willing to change your position on this had the ordinance been different. Can you tell me a little bit about what it would take for you to substantiate this ordinance? 

Sure. My writing in general is always about the equation and the variables and the measurable goals. My position on this could change if there was an equation, definition of variables, and measurable outcomes that came out of those. The first topic mentioned was ""serving the community greater good"". I'm not sure what that means. If it was defined in a manner that I agreed with, that would be a reason to support the ordinance in that manner. If it were defined that to extrapolate on that to say safety- was safety one of those things that served a greater good, safety has measurable restrictions to it. You know you can calm traffic with signals. You can widen roadways with bike paths. You can do the things necessary in support of this with measurable outcomes that currently aren't in the ordinance, but if written into the ordinance would say that serves this purpose. The same down the other examples that I said, but that would be the thing that could tip one way or the other on a writing and an opinion on the matter. 

Okay, thanks for sharing that. 

You're welcome.",Subject Matter Expert Statement: REFUTE
Interview Video and Transcript (2),"So this is the Subject matter expert interview for the refute statement. Hi, can you just start out by introducing yourself? 

Sure Jess, my name is Al Pringle and I'm president of the Keystone Real Estate Group in State College. I've been here for about 20 years, actually, 20 years last year, so almost 21 in State College. My background is, I have a civil engineering degree from Bucknell University and an MBA from Pitt. Nobody likes Pitt, we all like Penn State. And, I've been in this position in the development business for that full 20 years while I've been here in State College. 

Okay, can you tell me how you came to learn about this issue and how you informed your opinion about it? 

Sure, Meagan Tuttle had contacted us probably 6 or 8 months ago just for a general introduction session when she was coming to town and getting organized, we met her at that point and then as this process came through her office, she had remembered her discussions with us and reached out to me as a potential expert witness in the process. 

Okay, and could you give us your position on this ordinance? 

Sure, when Meagan reached out she had sent to me the instructions, the purpose of the ordinance, a little background work, and then the ordinance itself as well, and asked for a simple writing of do you believe whether or not this ordinance had met the purpose that it intended to create, and so that was my reading and writing from it. So I'll start by saying this, I ended in the negative to say that I don't believe it met the intended purpose. And I'll just touch on a few bullet points as to why I thought that was. 

First and foremost, we discussed a moment ago, but I'm an engineer and I love equations. Equations say to me these variables create a result and in this case I thought the variables weren't clearly defined in the result wasn't clearly defined and the purpose itself. For example, the purpose said in the first paragraph, first sentence, it was intended to achieve the greater community good. I'm not sure what that means, a greater community good means a lot of different things to a lot of different interests and interest groups, and I couldn't define that. In my writing I said a greater community good could mean things like does it have public safety, is it protecting property values, or does it generally organize the utilization of land? Those are things that could be conceived as greater community good. Not defined in the ordinance but my own definitions. From there I described this as to how I felt about the ordinance in its current draft format, did not meet current public safety protection of property value and or it mean that it was generally organized in the land. A couple examples of which public safety the location of this overlay in the downtown area is in a place where there is significant restrictions on infrastructure, there's no traffic signalization, there are no bike paths, there are limited site lines for vehicular traffic in that area and it really does not contain the supporting and feeder infrastructure of roadways, it's on the curve of Beaver Avenue into College Avenue, Calder Alley is a feeder to it and then the only one probably supporting it is East College Avenue as you travel west into town. The protection of property value, I think if you went through the downtown, there are a lot of properties that have the same intended purpose of this overlay district that would be impacted negatively by more supply. On the other hand, there are residential areas on that side of town that would say, they are going to negatively impact my neighborhood by the density it creates and the utilization in that area. That coupled with the fact that its such a small geographic area, basically a one block area, in the downtown, said to me its generally organized but awful small if there’s an intended use for a greater community good out of the land area. 

Second, as I went further in and going back to equations, and variables, variables have definitions and equations have definitions and what the ordinance lacked in my opinion was definition on any number of terms. One of the examples I gave was graduate student or professional. I don't know what that means- Is it graduate student full time? Is it graduate student part time? Online, professional? Is there an income level? How do we define those types of terms. They may be understood generally but at least the ordinance didn't specifically define what they were there for and being able to be measured against as to whether or not they met that ordinance. I'll contribute a little bit on the ordinance, it creates an undocumented occupancy process where owners are defined broadly as owning a unit. Perfect example would be, mother and father buy unit with daughter and daughter allows three unrelated relatives to live there. Is that an owner occupied unit or an undergraduate student unit? There is a potential for conflict. It lacked some measurable restrictions, the example I gave was it allowed for pedestrian access on the first floor in the retail area but didn't say how much could be pedestrian access and went so far as to show by example if I have an ATM on the first floor, that's a commercial use and an allowable use and is the rest available for pedestrian access and common space? Are we really trying to promote first floor commercial use? And if we are, we should prompt that with a restriction of what the minimum required to be at that level. 

One of the sections that I think I held in a lowest opinion was things that say whether or not a wall is 50 feet long and its desirable or not. I think those are subjective ordinances, not objective or quantitative ordinances where you can measure. You can certainly measure 50 feet and a one foot setback but to whose eyes is that desirable or undesirable? A statement like that would be more of an architectural review board than it would be in a land use ordinance in something that we were presented here. Parking, had to do with the distance of how far it would be from the site, within 400 feet of the property within 400 feet of that general area, there is no utilization for larger parking areas so by allowing it is great, but the actualization of it being used is more important. If you can get it within 400 feet, fantastic, if you can't, it should be left out of the ordinance and not a measurable statistic to achieve a variance from, or an increase from. Fees for offsite parking, all fantastic, it's great to have more dense parking, the unfortunate part is that it didn't give a restriction for how far away that could be. Building a parking garage on the west end of town with the money from the east end of town doesn't serve the purpose between the two. Generally speaking those fees have to be applied to a more restricted area. And then lastly, on that, the parking was noted as public parking was being defined as a more efficient manner. What's more efficient and how is it measured? Going right back to all these equations and variables, what do they equal when you sum them together. In conclusion, the biggest thing I want to say about this is I was critical the whole way through the process but I think that is what we were asked to do. We were asked to look at it with a critical eye and determine one way or the other. I could've easily gone to the other side of this provided a few more definitions and clarifications on what were intended here. I believe in zoning, I think zoning is a good thing, I think we all do, it serves a good of the community that I believe to be defined as it creates safety, it doesn't put hazardous waste incinerators in the backyards of a residential neighborhoods, itdoesn't create density where it's not supported by infrastructure. It helps to protect property values and those were a few of the things that I mentioned in the beginning. I don't think this ordinance creates any of that in that regard, it was more of a very subjective right on what we would like to see there.The owners of that land have certain inherent rights that they own by title for that land. Going back to King George that's how titles got passed and deeds became titles to land, that title or that deed gives that owner the inherent right to use that land as they see fit and the way that they see desirable. The specific uses of this is defined by zoning determine by whether they want to purchase that land and if they do, those rights are there. Going on subject of matter is more related as to historical review board and things of that nature that don't apply to zoning and I felt the read of this was slanted heavily in that direction of an ability to use incentive to get more versus the inherent right that comes with the property that was deeded by title to the owners. I closed with a statement from Thomas Jefferson that just says ""The true foundation of a republican government (and that's not democrat/republican, that's just a republican government) it is an equal right of every citizen and his person and property and their management."" It's the statement of one of our founding fathers and it's interesting to think that zoning and extrapolation of property in their management was in the founding fathers statements of what we do, so we believe in it but we also believe in the right that comes with it.",Subject Matter Expert Statement: REFUTE
Purpose of the CIR Process,"This draft ordinance will be sent to Borough Council to consider for adoption. In order to assist Council and the public in their review of this drafted ordinance, we are asking experts and panelists to review this ordinance through the Community Issue Review process. The primary purpose for the review of this ordinance is to answer the question: 

Will the proposed Collegiate Housing Overlay Amendment, which has been recommended by the Planning Commission, achieve its intended purpose?",Subject Matter Expert Statement: NEUTRAL
History of the Proposed Ordinance,"In 2013, Borough Council adopted the Downtown Master Plan, which provided concepts for redevelopment of various locations throughout the Borough. This adopted document prompted a property owner in downtown to explore the plan and its feasibility to promote redevelopment in the way according to the vision of the Master Plan. The property owner came forward with a series of suggestions about how the Borough’s current zoning would not achieve this vision,and a recommendation for a potential zoning district overlay which the owner believed would achieve this vision. 

The proposal was referred to the Planning Commission to review by Borough Council. Since July of 2014, the Commission has considered input by the property owner, the public, staff and its membership regarding the proposal. The Commission debated the property owner’s proposal as well as community goals and potential community impacts. Through a series of discussions, motions and edits, the Planning Commission has prepared the proposed Collegiate Housing Overlay Zoning Amendment which it has recommended be considered by Council.",Subject Matter Expert Statement: NEUTRAL
Purpose of the Ordinance,"The purpose of twhenhe ordinance is not spelled out in any one location. Rather, it was formulated through the input of the Planning Commission as it discussed this ordinance, is informed by elements of the Downtown Master Planand the Boro∂ughCouncil Strategic Plan, and is referenced in the various requirements of the proposed ordinance. 

When considering these inputs, it is understood that the purpose of the ordinance is to incentivize the development of buildings which achieve a greater community good. It is observed that multi-family, student-oriented housing developmenthas a strong market in our community. The ordinance was drafted to build upon this market by incentivizing an increase in development capacity in order to achieve the following goals: 
	
	Encourage new residential construction which includes a diversity of unit sizes and types with an emphasis on units which meet the needs of and will be marketed to a wider audience of potential residents, particularly graduate students and professionals. 

	Provide ground floor commercial space in a part of downtown where it is not currently required and further incentive the provision ofadditional commercial space. 

	Reduce vehicular parking requirements, through incentives, to a rate that is appropriate for development in a walkable, transit-accessible downtown environment. Encourage the development of that parking in structures that will reduce the amount of valuable land areadedicated to surface parking. 

	Incentivize LEED certified construction. 

	Encourage high-quality building design, the use of durable and attractive building materials, and pedestrian-oriented building frontages on the ground floor of buildings. 

	Balance the desire for building amenities which are believed to have a positive impact on the community with the realities of the residential housing market, financing, and building design and construction challenges.",Subject Matter Expert Statement: NEUTRAL
Ordinance Structure,"The ordinance has been proposed as an overlay which applies to the 500 block of E. College Avenue, for properties currently zoned Commercial. There are three elements of this ordinance, for which a brief overview is provided below: 

	The Base Overlay: Properties in the overlay which are developed with first floor commercial uses are still limited to 7 stories, but are eligible to increase the maximum building height to accommodate more modern floor-to-ceiling heights and are permitted to increase the residential Floor Area Ratio (FAR) to 4.0. Properties which utilize the overlay parameters must also provide bicycle parking. 

	The Incentives Bonuses: Properties which are developed with first floor commercial uses are eligible to utilize a series of incentives and bonuses to increase development capacity and decrease the required parking. Each incentive is eligible for a variety of bonuses as spelled out in the chart in the ordinance, and includes minimum standards which must be met to earn the bonus. These incentives include: indoor protected bicycle parking, underground parking, above ground structured parking, additional commercial uses, green building standards, and owner-occupied housing. Properties utilizing these incentives are eligible to earn bonuses which increase the potential building height up to 9 stories and potential residential density up to a 5.0 FAR. Additionally, properties may take advantage of one incentive to reduce required parking. 

	Conditional Use: Properties which have met the requirements of the Base Overlay, and have utilized the Incentives Bonuses to achieve at least a 5.0 residential FAR and 9 stories are eligible to pursue the Conditional Use process. The Conditional Use can only be applied to properties with at least 15,000 sq. ft. of lot area, and have 90 feet of frontage on all streets. The Conditional Use permits the property to increase its overall potential residential FAR to 7.0 and a potential 11 stories, and take advantage of additional parking reductions and fee-in-lieu for parking which cannot be accommodated on site, when certain conditions are met. These conditions include:

		Meets design requirements for façade, corner expression and exterior building materials; Design Review Board must review the design. 

		Meets requirements for the design of and executes a restrictive covenant for two floors of residential units which are leased to graduate students or professionals only. 

		Provides marketing materials and proof of tenancy for units which are leased to graduate students or professionals. 

		Provides additional building amenities such as community space, building access controls, and on-site building management.",Subject Matter Expert Statement: NEUTRAL

Really started laying out avision for revitalizing downtown and looking at how we grow, redevelop, and build on the character that we already have downtown. And so what came out of that was a look at what the master plan consultants laid out, kind of like a collegiate district. And that being East College Avenue, that being adjacent to campus. So, what you saw in 2013 was the property owners starting to look at the master plan and say well can I really redevelop my property in a way that achieves a vision coming into plan and was evident that when you look at the zoning your really couldn’t meet the purpose and the intent of the plan and in some cases even close, by some standards in what was already in place from a zoning standpoint. Our zoning ordinance was written in 1959. It has had over 210 ordinance changes since then. There have been amendments, but it hasn’t been looked at in a comprehensive way since the 50s. So, what’s happened is we kind of have a set of zoning laws for development that are antiquated and are really sort of envisioning a different kind of development, much more from the 60s and 70s in some cases. So, what you see for redevelopment is trying to find a balance of, well how do we try to have the vision of this plan start to play out and realize that the rules that a property owner would be under to try to develop the property don’t match up with that vision. So, that really came out of a property owner at the Kildare’s site. Looking at well how would I redevelop the site, it’s only a one-story property right now and realizing under the current zoning they would really be maxed out at probably 7 stories of primarily residential development. And, in this market, that tends to be student housing for undergraduates, typically. So, the property under brought in amendment to Council in the spring, to suggest, hey I’m looking at how the ordinance could be adjusted. And then, in July, Planning Commissions started working on looking at what was presented by the property owner and has really sort of been waying on the community input, input from Planning Commission, from staff, on that proposal and trying to balance the master plan and in just what we’ve heard from input and sort of balancing a number of objectives for that rezoning. 

Interviewer: Can you tell me a little bit about the purpose of this ordinance and what you hope that it will achieve? 

SME: I think the primary objectives have been the balance, what we typically see in the market as far as student housing and other needs. Other needs being how doe we get professional housing for folks who graduated but want to stay in the community. We often see that market segment squeezed out because there’s such a strong, heavy demand for undergraduate housing. We often don’t see in some cases space in the market for that kind of housing product. Secondly, there’s a desire to give more commercial space not only downtown, but on the first floor, to active the street, so to get more pedestrian uses, glass so that people can see into the first floor, and to make it a more active, walkable downtown. We have a lot of that throughout the heart of downtown, but as you get out to the edges, especially the eastern part of downtown, you don’t see as much pedestrian activity on the first floor and commercial space on the first floor. So, part of the purpose of the ordinance was to require that commercial space and incentivize additional commercial space that is in addition to residential that could already be billed. So, you think about it, the property owner could build 7 floors of student housing today, and I think the Planning Commission staff have been looking at is how do we get more than just that student housing. The other objectives have been how do you get parking handled in a way that isn’t just a surface lot because that’s really not the best use of our land. We are really limited in our ability to develop and so looking at incentivizing, going underground for parking or structured above ground parking that gets off the surface lot. And then other major purposes was to look at how you could incentivize green development in the building itself. What we typically call lead certification to get a better building design, build a better functioning building, that’s more sustainable and that’s expensive. So unless there’s a way to incentivize that a property owner typically won’t do it. Other goals is to get a well-built building that is attractive and people like. So, as we’ll talk about the structure of the ordinance, we’ve tried to incentivize that to make sure that it’s built at a high quality material like glass, etc. And then finally, really making sure that the residential space isn’t necessarily just undergraduate. And so, in some cases, we’re growing this new territory here as far as our zoning ordinance goes and looking at how we might require some of the residential space to be offered for graduate or professional housing. So we were actually exploring a regulatory way of trying to encourage that to happen. 

Interviewer: Can you tell me more about the specifics of the ordinance? 

SME: So it’s structured in 3 parts. And for someone taking a look at an ordinance for the first time that might seem a little clumsy as far as why do we have to do it that way and it’s really aimed at trying to incentivize certain things like below ground or above ground parking structured parking, the commercial space, etc. But, realizing that just requiring it may not actually get that kind of development built and that’s going to sound odd but right now if a property owner could build 7 stories of just student housing, why would they build more if they don’t believe that the risk is worth the reward. And so what you’re really trying to find is the balance between getting more than just student housing, but also making sure that the property owner is willing to take the risk and they believe they can get enough return on the investment to make it worth it. So, what we’re always trying to find is a balance, I think commission spent a lot of time on that. This has been a 9 month process. Try to find that spot where we’re getting more than what we know the market will easily do with student housing but not require or force so much that the property owner simply walks away and says well I’ll just build the 7 stories of student housing and I’m not going to do any of this other stuff. The ordinance is structured to try to build more value for the property owner but that value comes from non-undergraduate student housing.So the first part of the ordinance is to really try to modernize the basic CDA striker of the commercial district. That district has not had much change since the 50s. I mean it’s had some minor modifications but of all of our downtown zoning districts, it’s probably the one that has seen the least change and has the most sort of 1950s or 70s era. In that district, you’re capped at 65 feet for maximum height and there’s really no commercial requirement and for commercial space we tend to find we want higher ceilings. So we looked at how do we make sure that we’re not penalizing a property for having more modern, higher ceiling space. So, we increased the maximum height, but at the same time required a first floor commercial space. Which, we really don’t do anywhere else in the ordinance. So, we’re kind of looking at how do we start requiring some personal or commercial again to activate the street. We also then try to make sure that since we’re not requiring a commercial space, there’s going to be a lot more of a Floor Area Ration (FAR). This is how much you can build the building out on a lot. What we also found, especially out in that part of town is that we tend to have smaller, skinnier buildings that are taller. Part of that has to do with how the FAR is calculated in our ordinance. So, you’ll probably hear some discussion of that as we go thought this process as far as, well we’ve adjusted the FAR, and that’s really about how do we expand the building on a lot, so that it’s not just a tall, skinny building. The second part of the ordinance is a table of incentives. Things that basically say to the property owner, if you want some additional height or some additional FAR then you need to doXYZ. And those things are things that I think we’ve all come to some consensus are benefits to the community, whether they be more commercial square footage, whether they be underground parking, some incentives on parking reduction related to bikes and trying to get more space for bike parking,etc. And that lead certification to make it worthwhile to do that. So, what we have done as part of the process, is ensure that they have to take advantages of some of those incentives and then we go to the third part of the ordinance and that’s a conditional-use process and I guess to give the quick 30 seconds on conditional use, that is a process you go through where council says this is something, this is a use that is permitted, but in order to do it, we as a governing body are putting some additional conditions on it. In this case it tends to be focused on design and using certain materials in the construction. From a zoning standpoint, it’s not something that can be acquired, it’s something that we really have to incentivize. So by getting to that third part of the ordinance, we’re looking at some minimal design criteria and so we start exploring reductions of the amount of beds that can be in a unit, trying to mix up so it’s not a one unit with 4 beds or with 4 bedrooms, in some cases you’ll have multiple beds in the bedroom. So we’re trying to make the product type itself, not as we’re just cramming lots of students into small floors, which is kin of what we have in some buildings in the borough today. Again based on an ordinance that’s pretty old. So, the other advantage in that conditional use is that we started exploring a way to require that some of the floors and housing be for professional graduate students, not undergraduate. The basics of that is putting covenant on the deed that restricts that kind of use and we’ve explored methods of how it might enforce that with the borough and this is kind of a new thing, something that we’ve heard from Council, Planning Commission, from public, that we wanted to explore and see how it might make reality and this is kind of the first time we were doing something like this in the borough. And then finally, there’s also some requirements in there for some public space for community use in the building. So, that was additional piece that was added on as pert of the commission. 

Interviewer: Great, is there anything else you’d like to add? 

SME: Well just that, One of the planning commission members, while we were going through this, we discussed the geographic area, in fact that we we’re looking at just one block and we discussed this as being a conservative improvement approach to not trying to make a lot of changes for a lot of downtown all at once, and instead look at how to explore some of these things, like the professional graduate housing and do it in a fairly small area. So, one of the issues about this overlay is really only one block. The original proposal for two blocks, it was both the 600 and the 500 block of downtown, but based on public input and the planning commission desire, we shrunk that down to 5 or just the 500 block. And I think that part of the reason for that is there are some things in this ordinance that are trying to explore other ideas, like how do we get residential housing right next to downtown that isn’t students, or undergraduate students. So, that exploration is something that we kind of want to do in a relatively confined space. So, we didn’t want to make a big change for all of the C district for instance. And then be looking at this kind of height or this kind of development all through downtown is C basically goes through most of the East College corridor, all the way down I think to almost to where five guys is. So, that’s something else that I think participants should think about as far as why it’s only one block. 

Interviewer: Great. Thank you very much for your time. 

SME: Thank you",Subject Matter Expert Statement: NEUTRAL
Citizens Give Input on State College Government Issues Through Penn State Project,"As State College faces future budget deficits -- with expenses for services and infrastructure rising at a faster rate than revenue -- the borough is considering a possible proposal for an inflation-based index for property tax increases.

The proposal would have impacts throughout the State College community, and an ongoing Penn State project wants to see residents have informed participation in the process.

The Geodeliberation Project, a National Science Foundation-funded effort that's been under way in the university's College of Information Sciences and Technology since 2012, aims to provide a methodical way for community members to form fact-based opinions on local government issues.

On Saturday, State College residents will be able to learn about the results of work by fellow citizens participating in the project's analysis of the tax issue. and express their own opinions. A ""mass deliberation"" event will be held from 10 a.m. to noon at the Days Inn, 240 S. Pugh St. Interested participants can register here, and on Saturday will learn about the proposal as well as the in-depth analysis done by a citizen panel. 

""We’re facing this problem in all local government where people are less and less involved and they feel like they are less empowered in decision-making in local government,"" said Guoray Cai, an IST faculty member and principal investigator. ""They would very much like to be involved but there are few ways they have really found to work. Traditionally we have something like a town hall meeting, face-to-face but they’re very limited access. Sometimes they are at a time when people can’t go. There is a physical and temporal barrier to participate.""

Online forums, meanwhile often result in expressions that are strongly opinionated, but devoid of analysis.

Cai and co-investigator Jack Carroll, along with student researchers, have been working to find a better way for citizens to have a meaningful impact on local government.

""A lot of times you will have the people in government say that people don’t participate, and then you have people say we have no way to participate,"" Cai said. ""There is something missing in this process.""

What they have developed is a process that incorporates in-person sessions with an online collaboration platform, using topic research and expert opinions to formulate a citizens statement that analyzes a given issue and is provided to borough leadership.

Past issues taken up in the project have included the Penn State natural gas pipeline proposal, the collegiate housing overlay zoning ordinance, and the implementation of surveillances cameras in the Highlands neighborhood.

Michael Thomas, a recent security and risk analysis graduate who continues to work on the project, said the first step in the process is gathering as much information as possible about an issue. He and undergraduate research assistant Sarah Moore spent a few months collecting background information, identifying experts and conducting video interviews with those experts.

""Sarah and I look through a lot of information,"" Thomas said. ""Experts provide us different avenues. For [the tax issue] we looked at things like budgets, livability studies and combine all those documents to help the panel in their analysis.""

That panel comes from residents of State College. The project finds participants through direct mail to all taxpayers and reaching out to different groups and businesses. Panels are comprised of 10 to 20 people, and Cai said the project aims to have a panel that is representative of various community demographics.

""Skills in the community are complementary,"" Cai said. ""The idea is to have multiple skills and analyses to a particular issue.""

Once the panel has been identified, members are brought together for an in-person meeting. There, Moore and Thomas give them their charge, provide them with a binder of information on the issue and show them the video of experts providing the pros and cons of the issue.

""The people involved can also bring their own information to the table and can ask the experts questions during the project,"" Moore said.

The panel process usually lasts about five to 10 days. After the first meeting, members work through an online platform, and the research assistants facilitate to keep them on task each day. Over several days, citizens develop analysis statements and identify the key pros and cons. The subject experts, who also provide written statement, are on standby to answer any questions

Along the way, Ph.D. student Feng Sun, the system developer, is available to address any technical issues. He's also adapted the system as the project has evolved over the years

On the final day, they get together again in person to deliberate the key findings and draft a citizens statement, which includes five pro and con statements and the 10 most important findings.

""The citizens statement is completely made by the panelists,"" Moore said. ""If there is a question we think should be addressed we might say 'Maybe you should answer this,' but we don’t write anything for them.""

The statement is then made available to the public and shared with borough council.

""All the members of council have recognized this as being great input for them,"" Cai said.

The Geodeliberation Project was initially funded through 2016 and received an additional year of funding. Cai said it's likely funding for the project will end this year, but that doesn't mean the project will end.

""Ideally there should be a body in our community, a nonprofit that can take this on and organize this in collaboration with the community and the local government,"" Cai said, adding that the organization would need to be financially healthy and have strong facilitators.

Thomas said the research group wants to have a well-refined system that can be transferred with little problem.

""We want to find somebody who doesn’t have a particular stake in the government and vice versa, so the borough isn’t pushing an agenda through them and they’re independent,"" Thomas said. ""Somebody who is independent and values increasing community engagement, building discussion around social issues in the community. We’re looking for that third party group to facilitate and push this forward.""

For Saturday's mass deliberation event, Thomas noted that the inflation-based tax proposal is in its early stages and that residents have the opportunity now to become well-informed before it comes up in the fall. The increase would be based on the Municipal Cost Index and could impact not only homeowners, but also renters, university students and businesses.

""Pubic input is so important and should be a part of it,"" Cai added. ""The idea is that we can get more opinions expressed, and it will be representative of the general public. It’s meaningful for our community, but it’s also meaningful for our research.”",StateCollege.com
Kildare's Property Owner Sells Location for $7.5 Million,"A piece of State College property that has been at the center of heated debate within the borough council has been sold.

Jeff Haas, the owner of 538 E. College Ave., where Kildare's is located, confirmed that he sold the property to CA Student Living for $7.5 million.

The Chicago-based The Chicago-based real estate investment, development, and managment firm has over 17,750 student housing beds in its portfolio.

The firm has residential buildings at Illinois, Florida State, Florida, Maryland, Purdue, Arizona, Oregon, BYU, and other major university towns.

Haas first approached borough council last summer with hopes to re-zone the 500-block of E. College Ave., allowing for additional floors in exchange for incentives to reach those heights. Council eventually passed their collegiate housing overlay text amendment in July, allowing for an 11-story building on that block, four stories higher than the previous maximum of seven.

In order to construct an 11-story high rise building, the developer would need to meet sustainability requirements, install commercial space on the ground floor, and provide at least two floors of professional and graduate housing. Haas is disappointed that he won't be the one to develop the property under the new zoning law, but said that CA Student Living shares his vision for the location.

""It was always our intention to develop the property. After the collegiate housing overlay was approved, we were contacted by CA Student Living,"" Haas said. ""With the combination of the financial opportunity and that CA shared our vision for a high quality multi-use building for the property, we thought it was in our best interest and the best interest of the State College borough's continued downtown development of high quality multi-use buildings to sell the property.""

Haas always stressed building something nice on that location, something that the borough could be proud of at one of the gateways to downtown State College. He believes that the Chicago firm will carry out that vision.

""I will be disappointed not being part of the building development,"" Haas said. ""We really wanted to build something special on the corner. With that said, I am confident CA shares our vision and will build a very special high quality building.""

Representatives from the Chicago firm weren't immediately available for comment on their plans for the property.",StateCollege.com
Council Vote Paves Way For 11-Story Buildings on East College Despite Concerns,"It took a year to make its way from a local developer's dream to an amendment passed by the borough council.

Council members voted 6-1 in favor of the Collegiate Housing Overlay on Monday night.

The overlay district will allow for buildings up to 11 stories tall in the 500-block of East College Avenue, as originally proposed by Jeff Haas, the owner of Kildare's Irish Pub.

In order to reach those heights above the current maximum of seven stories, developers will need to include sustainable building features, commercial space on the first floor, and two floors of graduate/professional housing. 

The proposal came with plenty of controversy as it made its way through the borough government, and Monday's vote was no exception. A number of residents came to the meeting to speak about the amendment, bringing mixed reviews ahead of council's big decision.

David Stone, who recently attempted a council run before losing in the primary, says he wishes the overlay covered more ground and looked more extensively at zoning in the downtown area.

""I think there’s a lost opportunity to bring the community together around a more positive vision of how we can develop the town,"" he says. ""Unfortunately, that didn’t happen and we’re just considering one block here.""

Peg Hambrick, who lives in the Highlands area of town, has no problem with development, but wants to see it come from community members, not developers like Haas.

I am not anti-development and I am not anti-developer,"" she says. ""I think we have to start asking developers and incentivizing them to come forward with plans that we have made in our community. We need public partnerships with private entities and we need to ask them to fulfill our vision.""

Susan Venegoni spoke on behalf of the Highlands Civic Association, which has largely been opposed to the Collegiate Housing Overlay. She takes issue with the inclusion of graduate students in the incentives for extra floors.

""I’ve followed this plan very closely,"" she says. ""I think this sets a very bad precedent, particularly in that graduate students are considered professionals. I think that’s a slippery slope.""

On the other side of the debate, student representative Shawn Bengali spoke behalf of the undergraduate student government, which reviewed the overlay proposal and supports the concept.

""After studying the overlay, myself and the executive branch have come to the decision that we support it because it’s beneficial to both the students and the member of the community,"" he says. ""The first floor commercial space helps the economy, and the mixed use benefits everyone and enables diversity and a stronger community feel.""

Council president Peter Rosenberger spoke very favorably of the proposal. He recognizes the concerns many residents have brought forward, but says that adjusting with the amendment endlessly does no good.

""I think perfect is the enemy of the good,"" he says. ""We could tinker for another year, but I hand it to the planning commission. They did pretty hard work and came up with a good proposal. I think that if council votes no, we would regret it four years from now.""

Councilwoman Sarah Klinetob was the lone dissenter in the 6-1 vote. Among a few issues with the amendment, she says there are areas of town better suited for professional housing.",StateCollege.com
Is Sky the Limit? Vote on College Avenue High-Rises Monday Night,"State College developer Jeff Haas had a vision for his little corner of downtown, where he owns the building that houses Kildare's Irish Pub on East College Avenue. 

He wants to go vertical, expanding that block of the town's main drag toward the sky while also providing some benefits to downtown.

On Monday night, borough council will officially vote on the ""Collegiate Housing Overlay,"" a zoning district that would allow buildings up to 11 stories high if developers meet a number of incentives.

In order to jump from the current maximum of seven stories to 11, developers would need to incorporate sustainable practices, include two floors of professional/graduate housing, and build commercial space on the first floor.

The proposed zoning amendment has ignited controversy among State College residents and the council members alike. In a pubic hearing in April, some residents spoke out against the overlay. They raised concerns about the impact on traffic and the need for economic development instead of additional housing.

On the other hand, proponents of the amendment said the overlay would expand the borough's tax base and prevent student suburban sprawl. Haas, who brought the idea to the borough government, says the amendment would encourage eco-friendly and high-quality developments at one the main entrances to State College.

While council was split on the proposal as it made its way through the governmental process over the last year, it seemed to generally favor the amendment at a June 15 council meeting.

""I am 100 percent certain that if we do nothing, that section of town will atrophy,"" councilwoman Theresa Lafer said at that meeting. ""There will be entropy and buildings will fall into disrepair and the neighborhood will be hurt.""

Lafer was originally a strong opponent of the amendment, which goes to show how far it's come over the months. Councilman Evan Myers supports the amendment because he thinks it mightl have a calming effect on the neighborhood.

""Whenever you have mixed uses, that tends to be a calming device in that area,"" he says. ""That’s one of the main reasons why this has been put forth and looked at by the planning commission. Simply to leave it alone however would remove that mixed-use and remove the ability to have those calming techniques put into place.""

Based on discussion at the June 15 meeting, it appears unlikely the amendment fails to pass on Monday night. The council meeting will be held at the State College Municipal Building beginning at 7 p.m. ",StateCollege.com
Borough Council to Vote on East College Avenue High Rise Buildings,"The controversial amendment that would allow high rise buildings on East College Avenue is coming to a head and could be settled in just a few weeks.

Borough council voted on Monday night in favor of setting a July 6 date to take action on the proposed collegiate housing overlay amendment.

The proposal would allow for buildings up to 11 stories tall in the 500 block of East College Avenue. The high-rises would need commercial space on the first floor, and to get from the current maximum of seven stories to 11 stories, developers would need to include two floors of professional/graduate student housing, additional commercial space, along with sustainable building materials and features.

The idea was brought to council by Jeff Haas, who owns 538 E. College Ave., the site of Kildare's restaurant. Haas wants to go vertical at one of the major gateways to State College in what some people think is an underdeveloped area of downtown.

Council discussed the proposed amendment and heard from residents before voting on the action date.

""I just wanted to bring to your attention that there’s a petition going around online,"" says Smita Bharti, who created the Change.org petition. ""At this moment it has 116 supporters and asks that you please don’t approve this. It’s a bad idea and will cause traffic issues. We don’t know what the impact of the Metropolitan is yet.""

The Metropolitan, which is currently under construction, will be a high-rise multi-use apartment building at the corner of West College Avenue and North Atherton Street.

On the other side of the argument is resident Al Drobka, who wants to see the town replace older buildings.

""As our buildings get older downtown, I think this is an opportunity for incentives to build new buildings and have a diverse population within the buildings that adds to what we have to offer downtown,"" he says.

While council was generally split on the proposed amendment as it made its way through the legislative process, the group seemed to largely favor the idea at Monday night's meeting. Theresa Lafer was a strongly vocal opponent of the collegiate housing overlay at one point, but she switched sides somewhere along the way.

""I am 100 percent certain that if we do nothing, that section of town will atrophy,"" Lafer says. ""There will be entropy and buildings will fall into disrepair and the neighborhood will be hurt.""

While she understands some of the concerns people have with the proposal, Lafer points out that under the current zoning laws, a developer could still build up to seven stories on the block without any incentive to provide graduate student and professional housing.

""People have contradicted each other. People have misunderstood each other,"" she says. ""And they’re all sincere and right at one level or another, but I think there are some real confusions. There’s going to be an increase in population here and everywhere, and we can’t do anything about that.""

As she puts it, the borough can't house new students in the Cloud, as appealing as that might be to some residents. With the collegiate housing overlay incentivizing developers to build mixed-use structures, it can act as a natural buffer for the neighborhood, says councilman Evan Myers.

""Whenever you have mixed uses, that tends to be a calming device in that area,"" he says. ""That’s one of the main reasons why this has been put forth and looked at by the planning commission. Simply to leave it alone however would remove that mixed-use and remove the ability to have those calming techniques put into place.""

The coming vote could be a landmark decision for the borough. State College already has two high rise buildings under construction, and passing this amendment could mean a whole lot of height in another downtown corner.

""This will be one of the first things someone sees after going through the gateway and will be part of the entrance to the town if it’s ever built,"" councilman Peter Rosenberger says. ""It’ll be great if it’s something we can be proud of.""",StateCollege.com
High-Rise Building Proposal Heads Back to Planning Commission,"A proposal for high-rise buildings on East College Avenue has been a point of contention since last summer.

The debate's conclusion has been delayed, however. The State College Borough Council sent the proposed amendment back to the planning commission following a long discussion at Monday night's meeting.

Council previously voted to recommit the legislation earlier this month, with the intention of voting on specific charges for the planning commission. That process occurred on Monday night, but council had but one minor suggestion for the planning commission involving incentives for eco-friendly buildings.

The collegiate housing overlay proposal would allow for buildings up to 11 stories on the 500 block of East College Avenue. These high-rises would need commercial space on the first floor, and to get from the current maximum of seven stories to 11 stories, developers would need to include two floors of professional/graduate student housing, additional commercial space, and sustainable building materials and features. 

At Monday night's meeting, councilman Tom Daubert expressed concerns about the borough's ability to enforce the space designated for professional housing.

""I can’t see us doing zoning that would be very hard to monitor going along,"" he says. ""I think planning should simplify the thing and take out some of the parts that the neighborhood doesn’t like.""

But council didn't seem to agree, as the conditional use portion of the proposed amendment is essentially the only reason it's currently in front of council.

""I think the conditional use part of this plan is the most important and the most innovative,"" councilman Peter Morris says. ""The potential is there for us to set an example for the rest of downtown for mixed housing, students and non-students, in the same building.""

Councilwoman Theresa Lafer doesn't feel all that strongly about the potential for a high-rise building that is primarily occupied by undergraduate students, even if that building requires two floors dedicated to graduate students and professionals. She says that bringing more students into the heart of town will only increase problems for the borough.

""We are growing and our number of students are growing, but that doesn’t mean they all need to be able to walk to campus from across the street,"" Lafer says. ""Thanks to CATA, they can be throughout the Centre region, and given some of the problems we’ve seen with a small, dangerous minority, we need to make sure we are not nesting them all in the same place.""

Council president Jim Rosenberger strongly disagreed with the notion that another 100 or so students in a high-rise building within the collegiate housing overlay area would add to student foot traffic in town at night. 

""Holding this up because we don't want more students in the Highlands ignores the facts,"" Rosenberger says. ""Just across College Avenue, you have thousands of students living on campus who will walk through the Highlands to get to fraternity houses, so I don't see a building here contributing significantly to that at all. I'm in favor of this experiment.""

Rosenberger motioned to ask the planning commission to be more precise and specific on what incentives developers would receive for making a building with a Silver LEED Certification, which is a government rating given to buildings that emphasize eco-friendly, sustainable features. The motion passed unanimously, and was the only change ultimately referred to the commission despite a lengthy discussion on the amendment.

Councilwoman Catherine Dauler proposed a significant change to the proposal, suggesting that the collegiate overlay be used for exclusively professional housing, as opposed to mixed housing.

""I was talking with the mayor of Westchester and they got a lot of advice from consultants about the fact that they had too much student housing downtown,"" Dauler says. ""They have created some kind of an overlay district, with three buildings that are all professional housing. I think it would make sense to ask the planning commission to look at this as something that could be all professional housing, and not mixed housing.""

The rest of council wasn't sold on the idea, and so the only task for the planning commission is to elaborate on the incentives for developing an eco-friendly building. Because the change is so minor, there will potentially be no need for a second public hearing on the amendment before it comes to council again. The first public hearing featured heavy debate among State College residents.

The timeline for the future of the collegiate housing overlay text amendment isn't clear. The planning commission will have to add Rosenberger's recommendation and return the amendment to council by July 6.

Borough Residents Divided on Proposal for Taller Buildings on East College Ave,"State College is sharply divided about a proposal that would allow taller residential buildings on the 500 block of East College Avenue.

A public forum on the proposed “Collegiate Housing Overlay” held at Monday’s State College borough council meeting featured a lively mix of criticism and support, though the scales seemed to tip in favor of the opposition.

The proposed overlay has been a topic of discussion at various State College boards and commissions since last summer, when developer Jeff Haas first brought his idea to State College Borough Council. 

At Monday’s council meeting, Haas described his vision for a new zoning amendment that would encourage “ecofriendly, attractive, high quality buildings” at a “main gateway to downtown.” 

According to borough planning director Ed LeClear, the zoning amendment would require buildings on the 500 block of East College Avenue to have ground floor commercial space. Buildings could be up to nine stories tall at 102 feet, as opposed to the current zoning that caps buildings at seven stories and 65 feet. Incentives built into the ordinance would encourage developers to use sustainable building materials and practices and include graduate student and professional housing.

Borough resident Peg Hambrick was the first to fire off some harsh words for the proposed ordinance, calling it a “patchwork quilt amendment” that doesn’t plan well for the future of State College. 

Hambrick said she’d rather see the borough planning commission spend its time on the “long overdue” comprehensive zoning update instead of focusing on one or two blocks at a time. She also raised concerns that there aren’t enough economic opportunities to support the kind of professional housing that the borough council has been pushing for.

“If we really want to attract young professionals, we need economic development first so that there are job opportunities here,” Hambrick said.

Janet Engeman – who is running for a council seat – also voiced concerns, saying the borough is in desperate need of a comprehensive look at zoning. She also wants to see a traffic impact study for the kind of developments allowed under the overlay proposal.

But planning commission chairman Michael Roeckel (who spoke in favor of the amendment as a borough resident) pointed out that the comprehensive zoning rewrite is a lengthy, multi-year process that hasn’t even begun.

“If the rewrite was something that was going to be done soon, it would make sense to wait,” Roeckel said. “But this is going to take years to finish. Do we not want to do anything until then?""

Pat Vernon, another familiar face at council meetings, also voiced support for the proposed overlay. He said the State College government is clearly in need of increased revenues, as evidenced by the tax increase passed by borough council a few months back. Vernon sees the proposed overlay as a way to expand the borough’s tax base while also preventing “student suburban sprawl.”

“If you need more tax revenues, your properties can only go up,” Vernon said. “Vibrant downtowns make vibrant communities.”

Borough council will debate the collegiate housing overlay on May 4, at which point the council may choose to pass, vote down, or delay making a decision about the proposal.

Borough planner Megan Tuttle also briefed the borough council about the possibilities for the former Verizon Building at 224 South Allen Street.

Tuttle said that the Discovery Space children’s museum first approached the borough about moving into the 10,000 square foot space, which kicked off the borough’s effort to figure out the building's future. The Discovery Space has requested the space for either free or at a discounted rental rate to allow it to expand the museum and programming options.

Penn State, which currently rents the building for office space, has also asked the borough to consider a new proposal. Tuttle said Penn State wants to use the space to house its new ""InnovatePSU"" initiative, which would be a community resource to support start-ups and entrepreneurship.

According to Tuttle, borough staffers have also discussed a “public-private partnership” inside the former Verizon Building – which could theoretically include the Discovery Space, a commercial entity and/or residential housing. A community organization called Third Revolution has also expressed interest in the space as a potential entrepreneurial center for students and business leaders.

Council members seemed torn about the different proposals, recognizing that each one could be beneficial to downtown State College.

“Can we do it all?” council member Evan Myers said. “Everything that’s been proposed seems to bring a lot of value.”

The borough council will return to the conversation about the Discovery Space on May 4, when council members may make a decision on the building.",StateCollege.com
Public Hearing Set On Proposal for High-Rise Buildings,"After months of hard work, the State College Planning Commission presented the proposed collegiate housing amendment to the borough council on Monday night.

The collegiate overlay would allow for increased building height on the 500 block of College Avenue if developers meet incentivized requirements.

Ed LeClear, the borough planning director, provided council with a thorough report on the proposed ordinance change.

“The commission has spent nine months of work in our meetings to date,” LeClear said. “The current ordinance would provide seven floors of student housing and we wanted to look at whether we could have more variety in the uses of floors on that block.”

Jeff Haas, who owns Kildare’s restaurant at 528 E. College Ave., initially approached the commission with the amendment concept as part of a plan to develop a high-rise building on the site.

As it stands, the amendment would allow for up to 11 stories and 124 feet if the developer makes the bottom floor a commercial space, provides two floors of underground parking, and devotes two floors entirely to non-undergraduate housing.

Borough council members agreed to hold a public hearing on April 13 in order to gauge public opinion on the issue. At that time, the course of action for the proposed collegiate overlay district will likely be determined, though it seems to have support from most of the council.

Councilwoman Theresa Lafer, however, isn’t sold on the idea of a high-rise building on the edge of town. Lafer voiced concerns over the basis for the zoning change, which she says is a misguided argument that people don’t currently live in that neighborhood.

“The idea that as you drive into town you have a single building or even three of them at 11 stories is actually appalling. One of the things I find most irritating about this conversation is when somebody waltzes into these meetings, usually a developer, and says that nobody lives there,” Lafer says. “If you want to come walk around that neighborhood with me and knock on doors to see that people do live in that neighborhood – real people, not just students -- I’d be happy to do that with you.”

Despite the proposed amendment including incentives for adding professional/graduate student housing to avoid a building filled with undergraduate students, councilman Thomas Daubert worries that that project will be too focused on students.

“We need to have a discussion and make sure that what we’re doing down there is not entirely student-oriented because if it is, we’re not really doing what we want to do in State College,” he says.

Councilman Evan Myers was more impressed by the presentation. Myers thanked LeClear and the commission for a thorough report on the amendment and the various development opportunities for the area.

“To Ed and the planning commission, that’s the most comprehensive summarization on something like this that I’ve ever seen,” Myers says. “It walked through all the steps of what’s possible with the restrictions under the current ordinance and what would be possible if we go forward with this amendment. It gave a lot of information and I want to thank the planning commission for that.”

Later in the meeting, council heard a sustainability report from Alan Sam, the borough environmental coordinator. Sam brought up a potential ordinance to ban vehicles from idling unnecessarily in town.

“It makes our neighborhoods unattractive and some of these trucks can really fill up a house with fumes when they’re idling as they unload or whatever it may be,” Lafer says.

Council president James Rosenberger supports the idea. He explains that some European countries even make people shut off engines for the minute or two that they sit at red lights.

“I don’t think we should go that far, but I would like to see an ordinance come up along these lines,” he says.

Myers similarly backed the sentiment of an ordinance that would prevent air pollution in the borough, though he questioned where council’s ire has been on the natural gas power plant that Penn State wants to build on West College Avenue.

“If we’re so concerned about this, I don’t know why we didn’t speak out on this issue when the university decided to put a power plant by town that will put more pollutants into the air than any collective group of idling cars downtown ever would,” he says.

The council also passed a change to its ordinance on Student Home Licenses, establishing a fee to hold the license. It will cost property owners $1,000 including a $10 annual renewal fee and a $25 change of ownership fee to register a local resident as a student home.

LeClear says that there are over 300 student homes currently in the borough, with upwards of 1,300 residences that could qualify as such.",StateCollege.com
High-Rise Restaurants Possible Under New Proposal,"College Avenue could soon have some historically tall buildings in downtown State College.

The borough’s Planning Commission discussed possible changes to the Collegiate Overlay re-zoning plan during a Thursday night meeting.

The initiative, which is making its way through the borough government, would alter building height restrictions along College Avenue. In order for a building to fall under Collegiate Overlay zoning, it will need to have a commercial space on the first floor.

Under the proposed ordinance changes, developers could agree to certain incentives and, in exchange, be rewarded with taller buildings than are permitted under current provisions. The proposed incentives could include graduate/professional housing, increased sidewalk space, underground parking, or an environmentally friendly structure.

Ed LeClear, the State College borough planning director, presented the council with a slew of amendments to the potential Collegiate Overlay plan. LeClear says the required number of floors dedicated to professional housing would decrease from two to one in order to qualify for an additional floor under the proposed amendment.

“Two would be very challenging for developers to achieve with the current ordinance,” LeClear says.

Planning Commission Chair Michael Roeckel brought up the idea of providing developers with an additional free floor, allowing for a maximum of 12 floors instead of the currently proposed 11, if the top-floor houses a restaurant. LeClear says that the commission can’t require a restaurant, but it can require a top-floor commercial space and “give a strong inclination” for it to be a restaurant, which the commission generally agreed would be an attraction of sorts downtown.

While there was no official vote taken on the amendments, a straw poll of the commission indicates they mostly support the idea of allowing a 12-story, 134-foot building if it was topped with a commercial space. Jeff Haas, owner of the property leased by Kildare’s at 528 E. College Ave. and a large benefactor of the Collegiate Overlay plan, echoed that sentiment.

“I love the idea of a restaurant on the top floor, but it doesn’t even necessarily have to be a restaurant,” Haas says, adding that any commercial space would be great.

When it came time for public comment, State College resident Janet Engeman had concerns about using synthetic stucco on a building developed under the Collegiate Overlay incentives. The commission discussed the possibility of requiring a certain percentage of lower floors to be stone or brick, but didn’t reach a clear conclusion on the matter.

Borough resident David Stone had issues of his own, mostly involving the commission’s conversation on enforcing ordinances by evicting undergraduate student tenants who hypothetically end up living on floors zoned exclusively for graduate students and professionals.

“It is politically disruptive and divisive to be targeting any undergraduate students who ends up on one of these floors,” Stone says. “I don’t think it would be worth that divisiveness regardless of the technicalities of potential enforcement. I think what’s best for is not to divide this community.”

In addition to the Collegiate Overlay amendment, which will be voted on at a future meeting, the Planning Commission heard a preliminary plan for the State College Area School District’s renovation of the high school. The preliminary plan was essentially no different than previous plans presented to the commission and to State College Borough Council. A final plan will be presented down the road.

The commission finished off the agenda with a brief discussion on defining and expanding the use of pocket parks within the borough. Pocket parks are generally considered to be small parks built on irregular or vacant lots for aesthetic purposes.",StateCollege.com
Developer Seeks Ordinance Changes to Expand State College Business District,"A developer and architect who want some fairly dramatic changes to current zoning rules have taken their campaign another step forward.

They're pushing for ordinance amendments that would to allow an expansion of the downtown State College commercial area. That's intended to increase retail space and professional housing along College Avenue.

On Wednesday, for the second time in two months, the State College Planning Commission listened to details of a proposal from Jeff Haas, owner of 538 E. College Ave., the site of Kildare's, and Alan Schlossberg with architectural firm Perkins Eastman.

Haas and Schlossberg have proposed ordinance amendments to create what would be known as the Collegiate Housing Overlay, which would alter restrictions on building height and the number of parking spaces.

Haas and Schlossberg say the changes would help ensure completion of the borough's long-term downtown master plan, which includes redeveloping College Avenue from Garner Street to University Drive.

""We're trying to move this particular district of the downtown from a fairly low value for the development community and borough to a more modest or high performing value for both perspectives,"" says Schlossberg.

The Collegiate Housing Overlay draft proposal would allow unique requirements for apartment building sites with ground floor retail space, including building façade guidelines and developer incentives.

For example, in exchange for a site that includes underground parking, an emphasis on professional and graduate housing, increased sidewalk space on College Avenue, or a certified environmentally friendly structure, developers could be rewarded with an increase in building height, an increase in overall square footage, and/or a reduction in the required number of parking spaces.

Under the proposal, building height would move from 65 feet to 97 feet as a base maximum, with the opportunity to build up to 155 feet, or 13 stories, if the developer incorporates some of those incentives. The more professional housing the developer includes, the higher the developer could make the building.

The proposal also adjusts the Floor Area Ratio requirements, or FAR, which is a ratio of the total floor area of a building divided by the total area of the lot where the building will be located. For example, Schlossberg says on a 1,000 square-foot lot, a FAR 5 would mean a developer could design a building with a maximum of 5,000 square feet. Under the proposal, developers can increase FAR in exchange for incentives, such as wider sidewalks or more units designated as professional housing.

In terms of parking, generally the borough requires 1 space per 800-square-feet in a commercial district. Under the proposal, the base requirement would be 1.5 spaces per professional unit and a minimum of one space per three student beds with additional alterations in exchange for incentives.

Even with incentives, the proposal allows no less than one space per professional unit and no less than one space for every four student beds.

In July, Schlossberg said the targeted area is currently fragmented and not pedestrian-friendly due to higher vehicle traffic and a shortage of pedestrian crossings. The district also features apartment buildings with adjacent parking lots and little commercial activity. He says improving sidewalks, crosswalks and intersections and adding more commercial opportunities in the district could expand State College's downtown pedestrian-friendly experience.

By making adjustments to height and parking restrictions, Haas and Schlossberg say developers could create buildings featuring first-floor retail space, a few levels of parking and then several levels of residential space, which would eliminate the need for exterior surface parking lots and maintain levels of revenue through more rental units.

Wednesday's meeting was informational and gave planning commission members another opportunity to ask Haas and Schlossberg questions about the proposal.

""I like the idea, I think we just need to think about the numbers,"" says Chairman Mike Roeckel.

The planning commission and the borough's planning staff intend to further review the proposal.",StateCollege.com
Borough Council hears public opinions regarding the Collegiate Housing Overlay,"tate College — or at least a section of it — was awarded a Great Places Designation during Borough Council’s most recent meeting.

The award was presented to Mayor Elizabeth Goreham by Gordon Turow, Penn State’s Director of Campus Planning and Design. It specifically pertains to the intersection of College Avenue and Allen Street, which Turow called a “well used social space.”

He added that, as a whole, State College is “a great place even if you’re not a student.”

The rest of the meeting, which included a public hearing, focused on how to improve the already “great” downtown.

During the public hearing council members heard testimony from citizens regarding the Collegiate Housing Overlay amendment, which would, according to the amendment, “add value to the downtown and community” by requiring buildings to use first floor commercial space and provide residence for non-undergraduates.

The responses were varied, but for the most part, the public did not respond positively to the amendment.

Peg Hambrick, for example, said she appreciated the effort the council put forth regarding the amendment, but said she “[hadn’t] changed her mind.”

Hambrick continued to say there was no gurantee the amendment would lead to more professional residents downtown.

“If we want to attract professionals we need economic development first,” Hambrick said.

David Stone, who is among those running for Borough Council next November, expressed a similar disapproval.

Stone said the proposal was inherently incentivized a restrictive government, and jokingly asked if they were going to “throw undergrads from the upper floors” if they were found living in rooms they weren’t allowed to.

Mike Roeckel, a member of the borough’s Planning Commission, who said he attended the hearing as a citizen and not as an official, said he understood the concerns being presented, but personally approved of the plan.

The council decided to further discuss the matter during their May 4 meeting.",collegian
Taller buildings may be permitted on 500 block of East College Avenue,"While a new zoning amendment will likely not increase the amount of housing available for undergraduate students, it may lead to the construction of taller buildings downtown.

The Collegiate Housing Overlay proposed to the State College Borough Council would allow for additional floors for buildings on the 500 block of East College Avenue, Planning Director Edward LeClear said.

Buildings are currently allowed to have seven floors, he said, but this amendment would allow for “additional zoning on the top of existing zones” by permitting an additional four floors.

But there will be a few restrictions if a property decides to expand.

If a property decides to expand to more than seven floors, the amendment would require the first floor of the building to be used for commercial use, LeClear said. A maximum of nine floors could be used for residential purposes, but only seven could be used for undergraduate students, he said. The other two of the maximum 11 floors could be used for nonresidential use, he said.

With only seven floors currently permitted for buildings, senior planner Anne Messner said there would be no change in the amount of space permitted for the use of undergraduate students. She said any change in the amount of student housing would be up to the developers.

But, Messner said it would allow for additional non-student residents, which would add to the diversity of downtown.

According to the planning commission, the amendment is meant to achieve several goals. It is meant to encourage new residential construction which, if the property decides to construct more floors, “will be marketed toward a wider audience” and to provide ground-floor commercial space, where it is not currently required.

Properties that utilize the zoning amendment will also be required to provide bicycle parking, according to the planning commission.

Properties that develop first-floor commercial uses are also eligible to utilize “incentives and bonuses to increase development capacity and decrease the required parking,” which would include “indoor protected bicycle parking, underground parking [and] above-ground structured parking,” because of the walkable and transit-accessible downtown environment, according to the planning commission.

This amendment will only affect a property if the owners choose to add floors, LeClear said. If a property does not add any floors, they will not be required to do anything, he said. He said the amendment only increases opportunity.

Messner said it is possible that the amendment could lead to no activity at all.

Borough Manager Tom Fountaine said the owner of one of the properties on the block had asked council to amend the ordinance, so there is “clearly some interest.”

Messner said that all of the properties on the block were notified by mail of the proposed amendment. Some of the property owners had questions, but the planning commission did not receive much feedback on the proposed ordinance, she said.

The amendment was presented to council on March 2, and there will be a public hearing on April 13 during the borough council meeting, LeClear said. They will not vote on it at the April 13 meeting, LeClear said, they will vote on it at a later time.

The borough also asked for community feedback on the ordinance via the “Engage State College” section of their website, but they have received no comments on the website as of Sunday morning.",collegian
