Scot Chambers Interview,"Subject Matter Expert Scot Chambers
Proponent Position Statement CIR
Interviewer:
This is a proponent statement for the Community Issue Review. Let’s start out by hearing more about who you are and how you’re involved in this community.
Scot Chambers:
My name is Scot Chambers. I grew up around this area basically all my life. My family bleeds blue and white. My maternal side of the family has been here for three generations. My grandfather was involved in the formation of the art history department and many community affairs throughout his life time. My mother followed that same pattern and was actively involved with local government and university affairs throughout her lifetime and that sort of rubbed off on me. Throughout all of my professional life as a special ed teacher for the state of Pennsylvania, around here, and also as a realtor, I’ve always been actively involved with the communities that I’ve lived in and aware of a lot of the issues that come into play and helped develop communities.
Interviewer:
Let’s move on to some background. Can you tell me briefly about how you would define this issue that’s going to be reviewed by the panel of community members?
Scot Chambers:
My understanding is the issue is really about local taxation and what role that plays in development in the quality of life that we have here in State College or any community. I think a lot of that goes back to viewing what the role is of government, at all levels, but specifically here in our local government and what are we expecting from our government. I look at government as means of providing services and protecting the rights of citizens to try to produce the best quality of life possible. Those sort of services and so on require funding because nothing comes for free. The primary avenue in which funding comes is through taxation, generally on property taxes or maybe some sales taxes. Things like that. There are some other avenues such as grants, and money from different areas that may be available, but fro what I’ve seen over the years, the biggest single factor that impacts the quality of life is in relation to local taxes, property taxes primarily. What you do with that has a direct correlation on what the community can then offer its citizens.
Interviewer:
We understand that you are familiar with some of the history in State College and this issue. Can you talk through some of the main points related to this issue that you described in your position statement?
Scot Chambers:
Just real briefly on the history. I said I grew up around for a little over fifty years now and because of involvement with my family and people associated with my family, I’ve seen how the local government operates. I shared a story one point of having the borough council people talk to me and my friends on where to put bicycle routes. But we look at that and really begun to get a much better understanding of, I love this area. I’ve chosen to live around here. It has a very high quality of life. As a realtor I’ve seen that verified over and over and over again in various studies. But once again, it doesn’t come easily or freely. It requires a lot of work. It requires financing, input, upkeep, all sorts of things come into play and so this issue becomes the foundation of what we like.
Interviewer:
Would you say that also speaks to the main reasons why you’re advocating for this issue and why it’s important to the community right now?
Scot Chambers:
As I said, I love this area. I see a lot of it changing as the population grows, as technology brings around changes in our society, not only locally, but on a bigger level. I also see an interesting discussion going on nationally, regionally, locally about the role of taxation and what the role of government is. I think sometimes people get caught up in sounds bites of campaigns that sound really good on the surface but don’t fully understand how that relates to their homes and their properties and the communities that we live in. Taxation is a really tricky one of those things because there are many things provided through taxation funds that we take for granted. Then there’s been this big movement of “Sounds good.” I don’t like to pay taxes, there’s no doubt about that. I would prefer not to pay taxes, but I like having buses available. I like having safe communities I can walk around in. I like having good educational systems. You know, you look at fire halls and police services that are now being spread out to regional areas and the services aren’t as available. So I think it’s important that we really look at, what is the role of taxes, what is the role of government and why it’s important for not only me to talk about this, but for everybody to talk about this and really get a better understanding. I don’t know if our educational system gives us the background and the knowledge to really relate to these things. It’s easy to get caught up in the sound bites and the campaign promises and things like that, but we don’t fully understand many of the cuts in federal taxing and funding that went on several years ago is trickling down now to the local communities. And why you’re seeing communities looking at having the need to raise taxes to provide the same services that they used to get from money that came from the state or came from the federal government. As we see that source from the other levels of government dwindling or running into road blocks, hesitations, by default, what happens is each local community has to either provide those services and maintain the quality of life that we’ve enjoyed or we live without it. Unfortunately, it’s really through taxes as the best avenue to try to address that. I wish some of these other sources would come back so there wasn’t as much pressure on the local communities but the reality of it is, for now we have to take a look at what we want in our communities and how are we going to provide for it? This is a very relative issue.
Interviewer: 
Are there any additional documents, resources, or pieces of information that you suggest panelists reviewing this issue be familiar with in order to understand it fully?
Scot Chambers:
I won’t go through the whole list. I think the panelists would obliviously be wise to check with things like the borough, public works department, talk to the police departments, some of the services it provides, infrastructure, roadways, traffic studies. Look at some of the utilities, around here it’d be the State College borough water authority, the University area joint authority. Looking at information on, in regards to the police, what has changed over time with regards to amount and type of crime that has occurred around here. After living here for fifty years, I’ve noticed a big difference, well they would have the statistics. We have older, almost antiquated systems for our sewer and water that need to be addressed. Also, the changing nature of our society. The increased use of technology and mobility are things that the borough is looking at for dealing with water runoff issues. There they could find more information, direct information, on what’s happening within the community and what the borough wants to do to try to address that and probably, get a good understanding of what some of those costs are and get some real, hard facts that would help somebody decide whether it makes sense to keep taxes current with the rate of inflation or do we need any increases or cutbacks?
Interviewer: 
Is there anything else you would like to share?
Scot Chambers:
Just I love this process. I think many people think our voice doesn’t count. Yes, you can vote but that’s only periodically. I think there a lot of people who have thoughts and feelings that they don’t feel are heard and don’t get to express. Giving the citizens a chance to discuss this, I think is a wonderful idea.",Scot Chambers Position Statement
Scot Chambers Position Statement,"“Should the borough maintain and/or increase property taxes in line with inflation to address quality of life issues such as property crime?”
As a longtime resident of State College, the Centre Region and central Pennsylvania, as well as coming from a family that has been active in local civic affairs for 3 generations, I can easily answer that question with an unequivocal “yes”.
For 20 years I worked for the state as a Special Education teacher in several of the surrounding school districts, and as an interscholastic coach and PIAA official that gave me a perspective into many of the surrounding counties and school districts. These experiences have given me an opportunity to look at how different municipalities have approach governance, taxation and its impact on the quality of life that these communities have.
For past 10 years I have been a Realtor with the Centre County Association of Realtors and conducted business in this area as well as surrounding counties. This has given me another perspective on the diversity in lifestyles and issues related to this area, including how factors such as educational opportunities, transportation, law enforcement, infrastructure and the overall business environment can have an impact on property values and the quality of life that the citizens enjoy.
Growing up in State College was a wonderful experience that I didn’t fully appreciate until I was older and experienced more of the world around me. Thanks in part of the presence of the Pennsylvania State University there is an array of stimulating experiences and opportunities. There was also the ability to move around the area relatively easily and without much concern of for my safety, or need of services such as water, sewer, trash, etc… Education has always been a priority in this community and it has been supported not only by property taxes but active involvement by the citizens. All of these factors gave State College a high quality of life during the 20th century. During that time the university and town experienced good but sustainable growth while maintaining a good quality of life.
Over the years State College and the university have continued to grow, in part due to the factors noted above that have made it such a desirable place to live and work. This has in turn put more demands on local government to provide services for an increasing population and making improvements to infrastructure to meet demands as well as updating antiquated systems of transportation, communication and business environment. There have also been increasing demands put upon law enforcement due to the increasing population and more activities associated with both the university and this area that draw people from outside this area on a regular basis.
Demands on housing for both residents and students that have seen significant changes, especially in and around State College, in terms of demographics and the need for services in an expanding marketplace, as well as a change in the character of the neighborhoods that surround the downtown area and the university. Changes in the broader culture, primarily driven by changes in technology, are impacting how people live, work and interact on a daily basis.
State College has done a good job of developing and maintaining a high quality of life for its citizens. Data from the real estate sector supports this statement as we enjoy one of the healthiest markets around. Not only do properties in the State College Area School District, and the Borough of State College, sell for significantly more than comparable properties in surrounding areas, but there has also been remarkable stability over the years that frequently defies national and regional trends. Even during the latest and worst economic down turn this area did not see any significant drop in property values, only an increase in the days-on-market data.
State College continually ranks high in surveys of desirable places to live for a variety of demographics and increasingly has been identified as a place to retire, raise a family and go to school. As the business opportunities expand the demand for housing and associated services will only increase over time. The university and community as a whole have taken on the initiative of embracing the entrepreneurial spirit and growth in business opportunities. The need for small businesses opportunities, associated housing and updated services is expected to increase in the years ahead.
This will put more pressure on State College and surrounding areas to not only maintain the services already in place but expand and upgrade them to meet the demand for a continuing high quality of life.
To achieve the goal of a good standard of living requires a great deal of work, supervision, research and implementation in a multitude of arenas. One area that is often overlooked is in regards to the regulations and ordinances that are the basis of the housing, business, transportation and infrastructure system for the area. While I have heard lots of grumbling about “zoning” and “permits” it is clear that the approach that State College has taken over the years has been prudent and contributed significantly to the value of properties. Many of the things we take for granted, such as good quality water, sewer treatment, energy and communication infrastructures, well maintained and varied transportation corridors, public spaces and community events, all require planning, oversight and support services that are provided by the Borough of State College and the Centre Region Code Administration.
In looking at surrounding areas for comparison it is interesting to note that many of those areas are increasingly following the path that State College and the Centre Region have taken. Many areas that were resistant to increased code regulation and oversight are realizing that it has contributed to higher property values which has increased the tax revenue and made State College such a desirable place to live and work. The provision of services not found in other areas, such as recycling, public transportation and better building practices in general (including the impact of green spaces and water runoff issues) have begun to be adopted and practiced as those communities realize that prudent government involvement is a positive thing.
This point has been driven home all the more over the years as federal and state funds have diminished over the years. What first appeared to be appealing to many (nobody really wants to pay taxes) is actually a detriment to the development and maintaining of a high quality of the life. Increasingly it has fallen upon local municipalities to provide services that were traditionally provided by funding at different levels of government, for better or worse.
Whether that trend will continue or not, or even reverse course, is not easy to predict in the current environment. Locally the question remains, should the Borough maintain and/or increase property taxes in line with inflation to address quality of life issues? In my opinion there is no hesitation in agreeing that they should. I can see no sound rationale for doing anything else if we want our local government to continue to provide necessary services and protection for our community.",Scot Chambers Position Statement
Dwight Miller Interview 1,"Interviewer: 
This is the proponent statement for the Community Issue Review. Can you tell me who you are and how you are involved in this community?
Dwight Miller:
Sure. My name is Dwight Miller. I am the manager of financial services for the borough, so I oversee all of the financial services here at the borough, including assisting with the budget and preparing the regular financial reports for council.
Interviewer: 
We going to start with some background. Can you tell me briefly how you would define this issue that we are reviewing?
Dwight Miller:
Well the issue as I see it is that the borough’s revenue sources, first of all, are limited in the types of revenue sources it has available and then over the last ten years, the amount of revenue, an aggregate, has been relatively static because of the function of the way that real-estate taxes work and the fact that there has not been any real-estate reassessment since 1995. The only way the borough can generate additional revenue, especially through real-estate taxes, is by raising the rate of taxes, and we know that, generally, expenses will go up by at least inflation on an annual basis. So the borough is kind of caught between this stagnant revenue and growing expenses, and over the last couple of years the borough has been running budget deficits on an annual basis and using up fun balance, using up the piggy bank if you will, to balance the annual budget. And so the leadership here at the borough, over the last year, pushed the borough council to increase revenue to stop running those deficits. And what ot does is it causes bumps in tax increases, so we go a couple of years with no tax increase and then we run into this deficit situation, and then council has to raise taxes a significant amount to overcome that. The taxpayers see these years of flat taxes and then a big bump, then years of flat taxes, then a big bump. Under my proposal we would see regular, incremental increases in taxes to compensate for the inflationary increases we’re seeing in expenditures.
Interviewer:
You have more of a history with this issue, and have provided a statement that speaks to some of the motivation for being in favor with this position. Can you tell me a little bit more about your position in line with the major points that you outline in your statement?
Dwight Miller:
The issue is that real-estate taxes remain stagnant unless you can grow the natural base, the assessed base. And as we know the borough is pretty much landlocked. There’s no more vacant land to be developed in the borough, so the only way that the borough sees regular revenue increases is through rate increases because there’s not room for development, other than a few newer high-rises that we’ve seen. The only way the borough can grow its assessed value is by going up and we know that a lot of our citizens in the community are really not in favor of increasing the height of buildings downtown. So the only way the borough really has to increase revenue, under the current circumstances, is to increase the rate that’s charged on the assessed value.
Interviewer:
Would say that also speaks to why you’re advocating for this issue and why it’s important to this community right now?
Dwight Miller:
I think it’s important to this community because it provides some certainty to the tax payers. If we continue on the current trend, we’ll run deficits for a few years and then we’ll maybe see some new council members that will recognize that’s not good fiscal responsibility to run deficits and we’ll see big bumps in real-estate taxes, and tax payers don’t know how to anticipate that and when they have a year of large tax increases, sometimes that’s a burden, especially on citizens who are on fixed income or retirement income. If we can build in an incremental increase, an inflationary type increase, into that tax rate, then citizens know what to expect. They know that their taxes are likely to keep pace with inflation on a regular basis. They can plan for that, and they can vote for that. If they like the services that the borough provides and they don’t mind paying the inflationary increases in their taxes, I think it provides more certainty for the taxpayers and for the borough in terms of anticipating revenue. It helps the borough plan for the future and it helps taxpayers plan.
Interviewer:
Can you tell me a little about the process that needs to take place in order to have this be adopted by the State College borough government?
Dwight Miller:
Typically, what happens during the budget process is the council hears from the citizens who are against something. The majority of time that council hears about something, they don’t hear from individuals who are in favor of it because they usually just don’t take any action. So during that budget process, whenever council is considering a tax increase or tax rate increase, they generally only hear from the citizens that are against it, not the citizens who are for it. The process that I think needs to happen is more citizens who like the services and the lifestyle here in the borough and wouldn’t mind inflationary type tax increases, should come to public meetings and make their voice heard. They should come and tell council, “I’m in favor of putting an inflationary tax increase right into the budget. We should do that. I don’t mind that. As a tax payer, I’m in favor of that and I think that council should consider that.”
That would be a way that council members could feel comfortable, that at least a subset of the borough citizenship would be comfortable and would be in favor of that. Generally, public officials tend to shy away from that word of “tax increase” unless they hear support from it because most of the time, they don’t hear support from it. So I think that if citizens came during the budget process and even during the summer to public meetings and express, “Hey, I’ve heard this proposal on the street. I think it’s a good idea. I support that kind of proposal,” then I think council would be more comfortable enacting something like that.
Interviewer:
Who would actually draft the proposal?
Dwight Miller:
Council would ask staff to put something together. It’s really just a bunch of policy kind of issue. We have budget policies already built in that talk about what kind of debt to incur. We have asset policies. We have procurement policies and we have other types of budget policies. If borough wanted to enact something like that, they would tell the staff, “Hey, we would like to include a new policy into our budget policies that sets a minimum, inflationary increase on the tax rate. Then staff would actually draft that policy for their consideration.
Interviewer:
And then council would vote on it? 
Dwight Miller:
Right. They would vote on that and then it would be included as a policy in the budget document along with our other financial policies.
Interviewer:
Is there anything else that you would recommend panelists or other citizens review, in order to have a better understanding of this issue or to understand taxes or the budget?
Dwight Miller:
Yes, I think that it is important for the general citizens to really understand how real-estate taxes work.  I think many people understand that if a house sells and a new owner buys, that the assessment value of that home changes and the taxes go up automatically every time a house turns over. And that’s really not the case. The assessment value of a home hasn’t changed since 1995, and it doesn’t change when a home buys or sells. The only time the assessed value changes is when significant improvements are made to that property, a new home is built, or a significant addition is put on. Even when new development happens, the assessed value of that property is rolled back to 1995. For example, there’s some new high-rises that are going to be coming here in the borough, like the Frasier Center, and the county assessor will request a number of records from that developer, including what the rent is in those facilities, what it costs to build that facility. When the assessor comes up with that market value, if you will, of that high-rise then he’ll apply a ratio to roll that value back to what it would have been in 1995 had the Frasier Center been built then. That becomes the assessed value and the tax rate is applied to that assessed value. So until we have county-wide reassessment, and the properties are brought up to their current market values, the assessed value won’t change. The only way to change real-estate tax, in aggregate, is to increase the rate of tax on those properties. Sometimes we hear the words “tax increase.” It’s a tax rate increase, but when you apply inflation, all the way back to 1995, we see that it’s really not an increase in taxes. I’ve recently completed a ten-year trend analysis of the borough’s revenues and expenses, and if you look at the charts in that trend analysis report, you’ll see that the real-estate tax revenue for the borough has barely kept pace with inflation over the last ten years.
Interviewer:
Is there anything else that you would like to share?
Dwight Miller:
I think it’s important for citizens to make their voice heard. Often times, we only hear from a handful of citizens at the public meetings and it’s usually the same citizens that come regularly. I think it would be really great if more citizens would get engaged in the process, and especially the budget process so that council has a comfortable feeling about what the citizens really want.",Dwight Miller Position Statement
Dwight Miller Interview 2 (Video Transcript),"Interview:
Can you tell me a little bit more about why the borough is only increasing real-estate taxes right now?
Dwight Miller:
Sure. The borough is limited in the types of revenue it can generate. Under the local tax act, the authority of local municipalities is limited in the types of taxes that it can levy. And right now the borough focuses on four major types of taxes to generate revenue. The first and the most reliable is real-estate taxes. The borough knows what the assessed value is of the properties, so increasing real-estate taxes has a pretty predictable outcome. We know what revenue can be generated based on those, and the borough feels that those are the most fair taxes to increase. The borough also can levy earned income tax, and that tax is only on earned income. It does not apply to passive income. So it’s a little bit unfair in that it taxes working people who are working for wages and doesn’t tax people who have other types of income. We also have real-estate transfer tax and that tax is only levied when real-estate transfers hands, from one to another. And you can imagine, that is an unreliable source of revenue. It comes and goes depending on when people buy and sell property in the borough. The fourth tax is the local services tax and that’s a fixed tax of $52 for each person who is working in the borough. Of course, there is no way to increase that tax so that tax is a given. So for those reasons the borough really focuses on the real-estate tax. Now what the borough would like to have happen is for citizens to engage in a political process to get some change made at the state level to allow local municipalities, like State College borough, to have more options to tax. Some of them that have been talked about include entertainment taxes or alcohol taxes, in other ways to tax people who come to the borough for entertainment reasons but aren’t taxed for the services they provide. For example, when people come to State College for a football game weekend, we know that we get 80,00 to 100,000 people who come to visit for that weekend, and the borough has to provide police services to police that size of a community during that weekend. In order to have good quality police and certified police to provide those protection services the borough has to keep that staff throughout the while year to police just a few weekends. The burden of that cost of maintaining a police department of that size falls to the local tax payers because there’s no opportunity for the borough to levy taxes on those who come visit. It certainly is a benefit for retailers when all of those people come to visit, but the local tax payer is kind of left holding the bag for those costs. So it would be really great if the citizens would engage in that political process to make change at the state level to give the boroughs, and other local municipalities, more options to generate the revenue that’s needed to cover the costs for the services they provide.",Dwight Miller Position Statement
Dwight Miller (Additional Information that Supports Position Statement),"Proposal:
Borough Council should consider an automatic annual inflationary Real Estate Tax rate increase at least until county-wide reassessment is completed.  The index used to determine the annual inflation rate should be the Municipal Cost Index (MCI).  This index is an inflationary measure of the goods and services that are typically procured by municipalities.
Summary:
Natural revenue growth does not occur in the Borough because there is a lack of developable property.  Since assessment values remain stagnant unless new development or expansion occurs, the only way to increase the aggregate Real Estate Tax revenue is by increasing the tax rate.  Regular, annual rate increases provide the Borough with a predictable source of revenue and stability for tax payers.  
The Borough is limited in the types of tax revenue it can levy by the PA Local Tax Enabling Act (as amended).  The Borough currently levies these taxes to generate revenue for the General Operations of the government; Real Estate Tax, Realty Transfer Tax, Earned Income Tax, and Local Services Tax.  Since the latter three taxes are subject to fluctuations in the economy and number of residents, the Borough has been focusing on the Real Estate Tax as the primary source for annual increases in aggregate revenue.
The Borough should reasonably expect the annual costs of operating to increase by at least inflation just as every consumer and business experiences.  Other factors could increase or decrease specific expenditures within the Borough’s budget.  Without regular growth in aggregate revenue, the Borough would need to reduce the quantity or quality of the services it provides to the residents.
We know that close to 80% of the Borough’s cost of operations is related to personnel salaries, wages, and benefits.  Because of the market losses incurred in 2008, many defined benefit pension plans’ annual required contributions have increased substantially to make up for those losses and provide adequate funding to pay for current and future retirement benefits.  The Borough’s defined benefit pension plan is no exception.  
Double-digit increases in the cost of health care have dominated the news stories for several years.  The Borough’s health plan is structured as a self-insured health plan as part of a consortium and is administered by the Pennsylvania Municipal Health Insurance Cooperative.  Because the Borough participates in this consortium, its annual increase in health care costs has remained slightly below ten percent.  These cost-control measures still result in higher-than-inflationary increases in the Borough’s cost of health benefits.
The upward pressure on these two line items alone cause the Borough’s Operating Expenses to increase at a rate at or above inflation.  To some extent, the Borough is able to reduce costs in other areas through the use of technology and more energy-efficient products, but it is not enough to completely offset these cost increases.  Just as any consumer or business, it is unreasonable to expect the cost of providing services to residents to remain flat or decrease without reducing those services.  In order to remain fiscally sound and continue providing the current level of service, the Borough will need to increase current sources of revenue or discover new sources.

Susan Venegoni Position Statement,"The Question:  Should the Borough maintain and/or increase property tax in line with inflation to address quality of life issues such as property crime?
Some recent facts:
·    The population of the Borough is increasing but EIT revenue remains flat or is decreasing.
·    In 2016, 56% of the Borough revenue came from RE Taxes and EIT.
·    In 1970, 56% of the Borough households were Family Households. In 2010, that number was 24%.
·    80% of Borough households are renter-occupied. In some neighborhoods, that percentage is much higher.
·    Student enrollment at University Park is increasing. The 2016 freshman class is the largest ever.
·    29% of the 46,000+ University Park students live on campus.
·    Development will add more than 1000 beds of rental housing to the Borough.
·    Penn State has voted to serve alcohol and increase the number and type of events held in its venues.
·    Centre County has 72 liquor licenses, although it is allowed 51 (per PLCB).
·    SCPD states approximately 2/3 of their calls involve alcohol. PSUPD estimates that at 43%.
·    The Highlands neighborhood has the second highest rate of citations outside of the downtown area.
·    Police officers have been steadily cut from the Borough force for the past consecutive years.
·    CDBG funds not used for human services or admin are dedicated to Capital Improvements.
·    PSU ‘in-lieu’ funds are dedicated to Capital Improvements.
·    The 2015 property tax increase was 30%. The 2016 property tax increase was 14%.
·    Borough staff positions are eliminated or left unfilled due to budget constraints.
The Borough has changed considerably since our revenue generation methods were set.  Below is the current Community Development Block Grant map, showing areas with at least 51% low-to-moderate incomes:
As wage earning households have diminished over time, so have increases to EIT revenue collection.  Median household income 2010-2014 is $26,627. Per capita income is $15,915.
Per the Pennsylvania Uniform Crime Reporting System (http://ucr.psp.state.pa.us/ibi_apps/WFServlet), crime in the Borough increased in 2015 as compared to 2014. Robbery, Assaults, Burglaries, Forgery, Fraud, Sex Offenses, Weapons, Drug Sales, Disorderly Conduct, and Offenses Against Family & Children all saw increases. We need to strengthen our public safety capabilities, and we need money to do that. We cannot continue to suffer decreases in our police force year after year because we don’t generate enough revenue to support our police force.
Landlords are able to pass along property tax increases to their tenants, which increase rents and the load of student loan debt many carry.  The median cost of a home in the Borough is $278,100 per census data.  The Borough is making efforts to attract young professionals to stay and live here, and to convert rentals back into owner-occupied homes. Safe and stable neighborhoods are the stated number one goal of Borough government. But homeowners, particularly retirees and new homeowners struggle to find ways to absorb property tax increases into their personal budgets. For some households, this burden is becoming too difficult to bear, and in some cases, is deterring new buyers.  Some lower income households who are able to afford a home through the First Time Homebuyer Programs are unable to afford the property taxes.
When Penn State begins holding new events, such as the Winter Classic, NFL Preseason games, professional Soccer, or large concerts, what will be the effect on our emergency service capabilities? How many police, fire, and EMS personnel will be needed to accommodate the influx of new visitors in addition to the normal number of people who are already here, and the standard event load we have accommodated? Studies show crime increases within the two miles surrounding a stadium event.  How will that be handled and who will pay for it?
The need for public accommodations will increase as more events are planned, and short-term rentals will fill that need.  In some zoning districts, short-term rentals are prohibited.  Such rentals are not inspected for safety, have no permitting procedures, and many are businesses that receive the full Homestead Exclusion, which decreases property tax revenue. Positions in the Planning Department have gone unfilled and a new position was cut due to budgetary constraints. Ordinance enforcement will suffer as will the quality of life for Borough residents. The hotel taxes that are collected go to the County, to fund additional tourism. The Borough does not receive any of that revenue, although the tax rate charged will increase in 2017.
What challenges to our existing infrastructure will all of this additional use create?   Pedestrian safety, utilities, parking shortages and costs, and traffic problems are common topics of debate.  How will we pay for needed improvements? We currently have 9246 people per square mile in the Borough and we have aging infrastructure. How long will it last?
Tying millage rate increases to the rate of inflation will not be enough to bridge the gap between revenues and expenditures.  Will that amount become an automatic annual increase, and then additional percentages added to it to balance the budget?  Or will drastic service cuts be required? Can we afford that?
It is time for all of us, but particularly our elected officials, to actively lobby the Commonwealth for the authority to levy additional taxes and fees, paid by everyone who takes advantage of what the area has to offer, not just by the residents of the Borough.  Our demographics and focus have changed. Our methods of revenue generation need to change as well.

This is the opponent statement for the Community Issue Review. Let’s start out by hearing more about who you are and how you’re involved in this community. 
Susan Venegoni:
Okay. I’m Susan Venegoni. I have been a borough homeowner for 21 years. I did not go to Penn State. I did not grow up here. I’m a transplant, but my husband grew up here. I have a son who just started at Penn State. I am the president of the Highlands Civic Association. I am also the president of the State College Community Land Trust. And my husband and I are involved in rental housing management. I also do budget counseling and home buyer education for the borough’s First Time Home Buyer program.
Interviewer:
Now let’s move onto some background. Can you tell me briefly how you would define this issue that is to be review by a panel of community members? 
Susan Venegoni:
It is my understanding that the question is, “Should the borough increase property taxes based on the rate of inflation?” It is my understanding that it is going to be an automatic increase and I am opposed to that.
Interviewer: 
Okay. So we understand that you are familiar with some of the history of State College and this issue. Can you talk through some of the main points related to this issue that you describe in your position statement?
Susan Venegoni:
I’ll try. And it’s a few different venues. First, being an advocate for affordable housing, I am working with people who can, today, through the borough’s programs, purchase a home, but they are having trouble affording the property taxes that go with that home. And so if we are trying to increase home ownership and affordable homeownership, continuous property tax increases aren’t going to work. It makes the borough unattractive to new homeowners. As a parent of a Penn State student, landlords can increase rents annually to accommodate whatever increased expenses they are, you know, having. It also contributes to student loan debt when rent’s get higher and higher. And bringing it back around to my affordable housing thing, that’s why a lot of people that I work with are having trouble buying a home here or anywhere because of the amount of student debt. So continuously increasing what students are paying is not good either. I as a homeowners and also many of the homeowners that I know, people are getting older who’ve lived here for a long time. And some of the people that I know have retired, and so they’re living on fixed incomes. They can’t continue to pay and pay and pay on a home that they don’t even owe any money on, in many cases, and they’ve taken really good care of. They’ve contributed to the community so that’s really difficult. I also think that has we move to a more tourist based way of living, we already have the home football games, and arts fest, and first night. Now there’s the music festival downtown that I hope continues, and Penn State is going to start opening all of their venues to more and larger events like the Winter Classics, NFL preseason, you name it. I don’t know what all they have planned yet. We are moving to a tourist based economy here, moving away from the traditional ways this place is run. And the need for increased municipal services is due to all of the increased activity. I don’t see why that should fall on the back of the people who actually live here. We need different taxing methods to address these problems.
Interviewer:
So would you say that this also speaks to the main reasons why you’re opposed to inflation based tax indexing?
Susan Venegoni:
I am. I am automatically not in favor of any type of automatic tax increase. I follow the budget process and the borough very closely, and I think that everything should be reviewed every year. There should be no automatic. And I really have a concern that we’re not looking at cutting spending enough in some areas, where on the other hand, some things that I think are really important now and will be even more important as more people start coming here, is emergency services. We’ve lost police officers steadily each budget cycle and we can’t continue to afford to do that. So we need to be looking at everything, every year and more people need to get involved in what’s happening and steer those decisions so the right decisions are being made.
Interviewer:
Are there any additional documents, resources, or pieces of information that you would suggest the panelists reviewing this issue should be familiar with in order to understand this issue fully?
Susan Venegoni:
Yea I would look back at the last five years of budgets of the borough. Immerse yourself in it. It’s not very exciting but it’s very informative. Look at things like the F8 report, which is not being produced anymore, but you can look at the last couple. It will give you a good idea. There is also, I don’t know the title of it, but Chief King, the State College Police Chief, wrote a report a few years ago. It’s still available online, and it’s speaking to, then, what they felt the optimal level of police staffing would be based on the need. And we’re way off of that now. It was many more officers than we have. You could look at State College Borough neighborhood plan. The Highland Neighborhood, which is the largest and closest to campus from Beaver Avenue, we have the highest rate of citations currently of anywhere in the borough, outside of downtown, and it’s getting worse annually. There’s actually, just go to the borough’s website a dig around for a while. You can really learn a lot of information.
Interviewer:
One additional question is just how do you suggest that citizens, you know, outside of being involved in this review process, how would you say that they should get involved in, or what are some of the best ways to get involved if they have a similar view point. 
Susan Venegoni:
I wish that everyone here would get more involved in what’s going on. Particularly homeowners that I feel it’s a different type of investment that you make when you are putting down roots here. I wish rather than just when something actually is effecting them today, like a new thing, they would pay attention to what is going on. Many initiatives and issues come up and they’re all looked at separately, when in reality the all form part of a whole. And if you’re paying attention and not just reading what’s in the newspaper, but attending meetings or speaking up you get a fuller picture of what’s going on. And when a new thing comes up, like something like this, you can actually formulate a strong opinion based on what you know, versus “wow two percent sounds good.” When it actually isn’t going to be that, it may actually be much more. If we’re going to continue to have this be a place of diversity, that’s safe, and that people want to live and invest in for homeownership. But also, it’s spoken about as a retirement community, you know, everyone should be happy here in Happy Valley. People need to be involved and understand what’s happening and speak up so you can make it the community you want it to be.
Interviewer:
Is there anything else you would like to share? 
Susan Venegoni:
No I think that’s enough, thank you.
Interviewer:
Great. Thank you very much for your time. ",Susan Venegoni Position Statement
Ron Madrid Position Statement: BACKGROUND,"There are a number of reasons why Borough expenditures are increasing while revenue is stagnant and/or decreasing.  Among them are:
        • Demographics.  Per the 2014 census estimate, the Borough’s population is a little over 42,000 residents.  Of this total, approximately 32,000 are under the age of 25.  This demographic is increasing (+9.4% during 2000-2010).
                o These 32,000 residents are not homeowners and probably do not pay much earned income tax.
                o From 1970 through 2010, the Borough total family households declined by 31% (4,412 to 3,069).  Loss of households means loss of earned income tax and transition of single family homes to student rentals.  Family households in the region grew by 123.8%.
                o Though rental properties pay property taxes just like owner occupied properties, does the revenue generated offset the services provided by the increased density of occupancy?
                • Limited options for revenue generation.  The Borough’s primary sources of revenue are real estate taxes (16.4 mills), the earned income flat tax of 2.25% (1.3% going to the Borough, .95% going to the school district), the real estate transfer tax (1.5%) and the local service tax (LST, $52.00 ($47 municipal. $5 school district).
                o Real Estate Taxes.  Approximately 42% of the property in the Borough is tax exempt (e.g.:  Penn State, school district, churches).
                        In 2014, Council increased the property tax rate by 30% (11.04 mills to 14.4 mills).
                        In 2015, Council increased the property tax rate by 14% (14.4 mills to 16.4 mills)
                o Earned Income Tax.  Revenue generated by this tax is declining based on the loss of single family households and the increasing trend of younger (lower income) residents moving into the Borough.
                        The building of the high density properties at the Metropolitan and the Kildare’s site will add to this trend.
                        Per 2014 census data, median income in State college is $26,627.
                o Real estate Transfer Tax.  This tax is assessed upon the sale of property within in the Borough.  Because it is dependent on the real estate market, it fluctuates.
                o Local Services Tax.  This tax does not contribute significantly to Borough revenue.
                        It is not levied for income less than $12,000.
                        • Expenses.  The Borough’s principal cost is labor (salaries, pensions and health care).  Though salaries have increased, the principal cost growth has been in pension and health care costs.  
                o Services are tied to labor costs.  When you decrease personnel, there is a direct impact on Borough services provided. ",Ron Madrid Position Statement
Ron Madrid Position Statement: DISCUSSION,"        The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines inflation as the overall general upward price movement of goods and services in an economy.
        The BLS uses various indexes that measure different aspects of inflation.  Among them are:
                The Consumer Price Index which tracks changes in the prices paid by consumers.
                The Producer Price Index which tracks changes in the selling price received by domestic producers of goods and services.
                Employment Cost Trends which measures changes in labor costs.
        The issue at hand provides a very generic statement of proposing that annual property taxes will be adjusted based on the rate of inflation.
        The proposal does NOT define what definition of inflation and/or metric will be used to calculate the proposed adjustments.
                How will the annual adjustment be calculated?
                        Will it be based on the national annual calculated/articulated rate of inflation?
                                What time frame will this calculation be based on?
                                The previous year, quarter or month?
                Will the Borough’s definition of inflation adjustment be pegged to the difference between planned expenditures versus planned revenue for the coming year?
                        Not using a federal government calculated inflation factor but rather some locally derived one will hold resident hostage to an automatic increase of property taxes.
        The following BLS table details the monthly and average annual rate of inflation for the years 2005 – Apr 2016:
        As can be seen, the average annual rate of inflation since 2005 is 2.08% (22.8/11).
        The national rate of inflation does not come close to the 30% increase in real estate taxes levied in 2015 or the 14% increase in real estate taxes levied in 2016.
        The reason “inflation” factors DO NOT provide a baseline for Borough property tax increases is due to the fact that the increase in expenditures in the Borough budget are primarily caused by increased labor costs (salaries, retirement and health care).
                Depending on the employee salary costs being considered, the salary costs are impacted by union contracts and the state retirement system.
        It seems that the proposal does little to solve the challenge of increasing costs versus declining revenue, but rather to simplify Borough Council and/or staff budget decision protocols—make it automatic.
                The solution should be focused on obtaining authorization from the Pennsylvania General Assembly to allow greater local self-determination = authorization to levy additional taxes and fees.",Ron Madrid Position Statement
Ron Madrid Position Statement: RECOMMENDATIONS,"        Implement Alternate Forms of Revenue.  The Pennsylvania General Assembly must grant authority to local municipalities and permit them to levy additional taxes or fees.
                Authorization to levy taxes and/or fees does NOT mean that local government must levy them.  It only means that they have the opportunity to do so if needed.
                Borough Council believes local self-determination is best advocated through the Pennsylvania Municipal League (PML), a lobbying group.  Local tax authority is one of many PML priorities during each session of the Assembly.
                This has been Council’s de facto strategy for more than10 years.  So far, the tax authority initiative lobbying effort has been unsuccessful. 
        Potential revenue sources could include:
                A retail liquor tax.  This tax would be imposed on the retail sale of all alcohol products within the Borough.
                        Pros
                                Would offset the cost of alcohol related incidents. 
                                        Currently, 66% of the incidents/crimes committed in the Borough (public drunkenness, vandalism, noise) are alcohol related.
                                        90% of the physical/sexual assaults have alcohol noted as a factor.
                                Cost would be levied on those residents AND visitors who consume alcohol within the Borough. 
                        Perceived Cons.  Would be opposed by restaurant, tavern owners and their patrons. 
                                This is perception—and may not be reality.  No customer makes a decision to buy/not buy based on the additional cost of a tax.  Would you NOT buy a beer/glass of wine if it was $5.25 versus $5.00?
                A sales tax.  Allowing the Borough to levy a .005% (1/2 cent/$1) sales tax would provide a means to payback Borough residents for the services and support provided to the 1.5 to 2 million visitors to the region.
                        Pros.  Payback for resident investment in Downtown improvements that help foster a healthy business environment for owners/patrons.  Right now, when business owners have a good day/weekend, the Borough does not share in this though Borough property owners and earned income tax payers have helped to facilitate it.
                        Would offset the cost of police and other safety related services being provided.
                        Perceived Cons.  It would adversely impact the disadvantaged, working families and/or the poor. 
                                The reality is that not many Borough residents regardless of income level, spend a significant portion of their disposable income in the Borough.  In any case, a .005% tax would have negligible adverse impact on any person and/or business.
                Hotel Room Tax.  This is a county tax assessed for all hotels, inns and bed & breakfasts.  The revenue supports the Centre County Convention & Visitors Bureau.
                        The rate is currently 2.5% and in 2014, the county took in $1.3 million.  Rooms in the Borough generated approximately $670,000 in hotel occupancy taxes. 
                        The revenue generated funds tourism marketing and visitor bureaus.
                                Tax does not offset the cost of local services provided when these tourism initiatives are successful!
                        The state allows a 3% tax. 
                                This rate may increase.
                        If allowed, the Borough could impose a hotel room tax of just .005% (1/2 cent per $1) and bring the current allowed tax up to the 3%.  This could generate over $134,000.
                        This tax paid by visitors would offset the costs that Borough residents must pay to provide services to visitors of the Borough.
                        Even more revenue could be generated if short-term rentals (e.g. Airbnb) were included.
        Investigate the potential of levying fees versus taxes. 
                A tax is a means to generate revenue and can be used in a variety of ways.
                A fee is a cost passed on to those who receive some specific benefit, activity and/or service.
                One person’s tax could be another person’s fee.
                The term “tax” is a volatile one among legislators.  However, a fee might be a different story.
                A local levied safety/security fee on alcohol/rooms “might” be a politically acceptable means to provide self-determination without the state legislators giving-up control of tax levying authority.",Ron Madrid Position Statement
Ron Madrid Interview,"Interviewer:
This is opponent statement for the Community Issue Review. Let’s start out. Could you tell us who you are and what your background is in this community?
Ron Madrid:
Hi my name is Ron Madrid. I am a 21-year resident of State College. I’m employed at Penn State University as an administrator. I work at the Applied Research Lab. I’m currently, and have been for the last 10 plus years, president of the Holmes-Foster Neighborhood Association. I am a three-time loser candidate for borough council, and a one-time loser candidate for mayor. So my involvement in the community and my fluency in the issues are somewhat unique in that I am involved in the community. I make it a point to stay involved because I think we live in a wonderful community with a bunch of wonderful people and I don’t want our community to die. And the budget of the borough and its impact on its citizens and residents, is a cause or could be a cause of a dying community because a community without revenue to pay for the goods and services to support our quality of life is a symptom of a dying community.
Interviewer:
Thank you. So let’s move on to some of the background. Can you tell briefly how you would define this issue that’s going to be reviewed by the group of panelists?
Ron Madrid:
Well inflation or indexing of property tax to some calculated or determined or made up index is only part of the problem. The basic problem is borough revenues are growing, excuse me, borough expenses are growing while revenues are shrinking or flat-lining. And so that delta between the increase in expenditures and decreasing revenue, per say, is the issue. Now because the borough only has three real sources of revenue being property taxes, earned income tax, and land transfer tax, that’s the main component =s of our revenue by state law. That means that when they need to increase revenue they can only go to those three sources. Because our community ids losing single-family homes over the last 10 to 15 years, that means that as those single-family homes migrate out of the borough and lower income or renters come in to borough that means they aren’t going to be paying much into that earned income tax pool. So that pool is shrinking. The land transfer tax, because there’s only 4.9 square miles, and there isn’t much, there is very little, probably 3 or 4 lots in the entire borough that are quote “undeveloped.” That means that unless redevelopment occurs we’re not going to get much land transfer tax in, and many people stay in the community so the turnover of housing doesn’t really occur very often so that land transfer tax isn’t a great component. Which leaves property tax for those residents of the borough who own property, business owners and home owners, to pick up that burden. That is difficult because again, the demographics. We have a lot of people under 25, not a lot of people over 55. Those over 55, a great majority are retired so they don’t pay into the earned income tax pool and they are on relatively fixed incomes so when they’re stuck with increasing property taxes like has happened over the last two years, that’s a significant strain. What happens then is, long time residents who love the community, love State College, would never want to move, now have to say, “Is this next tax increase really going to be that straw that broke the camel’s back and really forced me, though I don’t want to, really forced me to consider to sell my house that’s probably much larger than I need and move to a smaller place closer to my children, warmer climate, etc., etc.?” So that in itself is sad in that were losing gifted and wonderful people leaving the community. Hopefully younger families will move in. But the medium price of single-family households in State College is rather high. So unless you work for the University and have a steady job, with prices at the 200,000 to 300,000-dollar range on the average, that’s not an average house that many young couples can afford to move in to. Especially in the more established neighborhoods.
Interviewer:
And so, I think you’ve already touched on some of these, but we understand that you are very familiar with the history of State College and a lot of the background on this issue. Can you summarize some of the main points you’ve provided in the position statement?
Ron Madrid:
This is not new to council. This has been brought up. If you review the annual budget submitted by the borough manager every year. Go back as long as you want and in the first two pages of the executive summary, he usually puts down, he had put down prior to 2014, that again expenditures were growing longer, faster than revenue and that we were going to hit an impasse in the 2015, 2016 timeframe, which in fact, it did occur. So it’s no surprise. It should be no surprise to members of council who have been familiar with this issue for a long time. And for them to say, “Oh dear, oh my, well what can we do? We tried.” Now their trying is “well we work with Pennsylvania Municipal League who is a lobbying organization for all municipalities in the state and they are our voice in Harrisburg to convince the assembly, both houses, to allow us to levy increased taxes. That’s a great statement, it’s like “Well we did it.” But the Pennsylvania Municipal League has many issues and priorities, of which this is just one, okay. From my perspective, this is our one and only priority because without increase ability to raise revenue. We don’t care if there’s a tax on sugary drinks. We don’t care if there’s a problem with arbitration between public service unions and the state. We don’t care about carbon tax or more bike friendly grants and what not. Now those are all great causes, but the pale in comparison to the ability of a municipality, a place like State College, to maintain its goods and services to support its residents and to support the quality of life. Okay, now I’m not saying the other ones are less important. I’m just saying they’re not as important as this one. And from my perspective saying, “Well we’ll give to Pennsylvania Municipal League,” then we become one of many hundred or two hundred different voices saying, “This is our most important. This is most important.” They take a poll and say, “Okay, our top three are “baboom” (whatever it is), and if this is one of them, fine, if it’s number one. If it’s not number one it’s not fine as far as I’m concerned.”
Interviewer:
Would you describe how this speaks to the main reasons why you’re opposed to inflation based tax indexing?
Ron Madrid:
Right, what that says is that it’s very easy then. Then the council and staff can say, and as I pointed out in my paper, it’s inflation based tax increases. It’s a statement. There’s no documentation. How are you going to figure that? And I provided you with the table from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on the annual rate of inflation for the last eleven years. That average is just a little over 2%. So if they’re saying, “Well if we went that route we would determine on what?”  On what last year’s rate of inflation was? In some years it was a negative. So are we going to cut taxes? Oh no we can’t do that because the expenditures have gone up. Ok, 2%? Well we need more than 2%. So you’re only going to raise them 2%? Well that’s not what we’re saying. So again, unless you define that index. And to me, for someone to say, to come up with this very simplistic statement means to me is, they’d rather just say is, “We’re going to calculate an index and that’s what we’re going to peg the property taxes to.” So for instance if the state retirement board comes in 2016 for 2017 and says, “You know what? To pay for the retirement costs of those employees in the borough who participate in the state retirement system, you’re going to have to cough up another 10% more on your retirement income.” Ok so that’s one metric. Then there’s, you know, increasing expenses and other functions that the borough supports. That’s another thing. So it comes out to say, “We need an extra million dollars in next year’s budget.” And so that would equate to, so that would be quote “inflation index.” Okay, so it’s not based on some externally standardized one. It’s one that they’ve created themselves so then they don’t have to deliberate at all. Every December they come in and say, “Okay. We estimate in the next year “x” amount of revenue and “y” amount of expenses. We’re going to make the revenue equal expanses so that delta is now the increase in property tax. And then they can say, well we go to them and say, “How? You can’t do that.” “Well that’s what everybody agreed upon. We consulted. We had a working group. People, citizens got together. We discussed it. We decided and that’s it.” A very simple way to do that and I don’t see that as not governance. That’s just a cop out. Okay, every budget is a fight, should be a fight. Okay, every budget should be based on zero based budgeting, not last year’s budget plus 3% because we just kind of build that in there. It should be zero. We start again. We know what it is. And then everybody, every function of the borough fights to get their piece for the next year because it’s my money, not your money. Okay, and what is often left out in the discussion is, again based on the demographics and make up of our residents of the borough, every decision that council makes, they should be asking themselves, “Is this decision going to make somebody leave the borough?” And they don’t do that. They kind of go it’s either some social cause that they’re in favor of or some pet rock they’re in favor of. “Oh yea, let’s do that!” And the rest of us are going, “Why would you do that?” Again, I’m not saying that it’s a bad idea, but there’s other to do that. Again, provide me, maintain my quality of life and if possible, increase it. Don’t cut goods and services. Make sure we get full value for each dollar that we pay. That should be the priority. Again, not something that’s ginned up because it makes them feel good.
Interviewer:
Are there any additional documents, resources, or pieces of information that you would suggests that panelists familiarize themselves with as they review this issue?
Ron Madrid:
Again, I would look at the previous year’s annual budgets, and just at that. And just look at the front end where they discuss the challenges for the coming year. That kind of puts things into perspective. I would also as them to see the borough’s, every year right at the beginning of year, January, February, March timeframe, they decide and endorse the priorities for the Pennsylvania Municipal League. And If you look over the last couple of years and look over the deliberations, you’ll see that self-determination or the ability to levy taxes, they might spend like 30 or 45 seconds on that issue and then spend an hour on some other issue or other issues that they think are socially, environmentally, or are more important. Okay, and again that seems out of kilter to me. This is the priority. Okay, if you want me to move, keep on doing what you’re doing and ill move. You’re going to lose my earned income, and I think youre going to lose a valuable resident along with some other people that really care about the community. And what am I going to do with my property? Well because I live on West Beaver Avenue, it’s not the optimum place for a single family home. I’ll probably have to rent it.
Interviewer:
Is there anything else that you would like to share?
Ron Madrid:
No.

General Fund Overview,"                Real Estate Tax – a two-mill Real Estate Tax increase provides an additional $909,208 of revenue.
                Transfers to Other Funds – a $29,105 transfer to Bus Terminal and a $29,870 transfer to Bellaire Court are included in the 2016 Budget. Both transfers are needed to fund the operating budget deficits in each Fund.
                Insurance Reserve Fund – In 2015, Unemployment Claims, Employee Wellness, Prefunded Health Savings Account Deductibles and Retiree Health Insurance expenses were transferred to the Insurance Reserve Fund along with the revenue from health insurance premium refunds. The move reduced operating expenses in the General Fund, but shifts the expense burden to the Insurance Reserve Fund. Although the Insurance Reserve Fund can absorb an operating loss, losses beyond 2016 will reduce the available cash balance below the recommended reserve amount.
                Staff Reductions – Two full-time Police Officers, one Housing Specialist, three Engineering Interns and one full-time Public Works Foreman.

*** The following is a document relating to the issue of property crime in the State College Borough. Property crime is just one of the many “quality of life” issues that may be addressed. ***
Below you can find the Executive Summary extracted from the First Eight (F8) program report.
[The First Eight (F8) program is a collaborative effort of Penn State University and State College Borough to address issues that arise in neighborhoods near campus as students return to town for the fall semester. The program was initiated in 2007 following visits to and consultations with several other communities that host major universities and had started similar programs with encouraging results. Our own experience, and that of other university communities, is that the first weeks of the new school year is a critical time to set the tone for the entire year. Collaboration among the officials and agencies enables us to focus our efforts where they will have the greatest impact. Additional details on the development of the F8 program may be found in the Appendix.
This report provides an overview of the F8 program in the Highlands, Holmes-Foster and College Heights neighborhoods. The data presented in this report are for these specific neighborhoods, and not the entire Borough, unless noted. All data are for a 16 week period for each year beginning in mid August.
Police activity has been tracked in 8 categories. These categories, while not covering the full range of police activity, are key indicators of activity that contributes to neighborhood issues. The Police
categories reported here are:
• Alcohol
• Assaults/Fights/Harassment
• Criminal Mischief/Trespass
• Drug Offenses
• Noise Offenses
• Public Urination
• Sex Crimes
• Thefts
The key indicator tracked for Ordinance Enforcement was the number of refuse violations. The offenses tracked for F8 are those that typically have the most direct impact on residents’ perceptions of the quality of life in their neighborhood. Other work of the police, code enforcement and ordinance enforcement staff is equally important, but is not as directly related to neighborhood issues.
The F8 program is part of the Borough’s efforts to meet the following goals:
        Communicate expectations for being members of the Penn State and State College      Community
        Maintain safe, healthy and vibrant neighborhoods
        Promote positive relations between student and non-student residents
        Improve quality of life in neighborhoods near campus
        Improve communication among students and non-students and between organizations
        Build community
        Stabilize property values and tax base
As described in the report, key indicators suggest that there has been progress in meeting these goals and maintaining the quality of life in Borough neighborhoods near campus.
        Offenses reported to the police in the neighborhoods for the F8 study periods in 2007-2012 were below 2006 (pre-F8) levels.
        Arrests for alcohol violations in the neighborhoods for the F8 study periods in 2007-2012 were below 2006 (pre-F8) levels.
        Citizen survey results in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2102 showed that more than 85 percent of non-student residents Borough-wide believe their neighborhood is a good or excellent place to live – an approval rating similar to that of other communities participating in the NCS. (No comparable survey for 2006.)
        The favorable response rate on survey questions related to quality of life in State College and in the respondents’ neighborhood was higher in State College than it was in other university communities 25,000 – 99,000 in population that participated in the national citizen survey.
The report examines offenses in 26 police reporting areas (RAs) in whole or in part. These RAs were selected because they encompass the neighborhoods adjacent to either downtown or campus. A map of these RAs may be found in the appendix on page 36. An examination of the data for each of these 26 RAs reveals that the number of violations varies substantially depending on which RA you are focusing on. In 2012, the RAs with the lowest total number of violations are E9 and F1. E9 is located in the eastern section of the Highlands North while the F1 is located in the Holmes-Foster neighborhood between S. Sparks Street and Corl Street. The RA with the highest number of violations is D6, which is bounded by Locust Lane, E. Foster Avenue, Pugh Street, and E. Beaver Avenue. For the 7 years examined in the report, RA F2 experienced a total of 15 violations while a total of 608 violations were logged in RA D7. In fact, of the 26 RAs for which data were examined, 6 of them (slightly less than 25% of the RAs) accounted for nearly half (45%) of the violations. These wide differences in total violations in the different RAs must be factored into any intervention strategies that are pursed.
Conclusions and Recommendations
While it is encouraging to see positive overall trends in the neighborhoods included in the F8 program, additional analysis is needed for several sub-neighborhood areas identified through the report. Moreover, factors may have contributed to the positive reports for 2007-2012. The number of home football games was higher in 2009, contributing to an increase in some offenses above 2007 and 2008 levels (but still below 2006 levels.) Weather also has an impact on any given weekend’s activities. Nevertheless, F8 seems to have made a difference and the programs are helping to maintain and improve the quality of life in the neighborhoods near campus.
Based on the data and the assessments by the participants, continuation of the F8 program is recommended. Additional recommendations include the following:
        Establish a contact group with landlords whose properties have historically created problems in neighborhoods to ensure full participation of landlords in addressing problems occurring at their properties. This contact group should begin working prior to the start of the semester and focus on both preventative measures and intervention strategies.
        Continue focus on noise violations, including officer initiated citations for such violations. (Note – if this enforcement is increased substantially the noise violations numbers will likely increase – see discussion in Appendix 7 on officer-initiated versus complaint response enforcement.)
        Increase pre-party contacts and other proactive measures, and explore the feasibility of implementing a party registration program.
        Focus resources on those Police RAs where the greatest number of offenses have historically occurred.
        Increase focus on large parties and gatherings that result in negative impacts on neighborhoods; and continue designating specific teams to be assigned to this effort on a regular basis.
        Continue the NEAT (Neighborhood Enforcement Alcohol Teams), a cooperative effort between State College Borough and Penn State police departments focused on enforcement in neighborhoods south of campus and downtown.
        Explore new ways for the Borough and Penn State police to collaborate on intervention and enforcement in neighborhoods near campus when Penn State students are involved.
        Work with Penn State administrators to find new ways to enable the University to address issues with students and landlords when major neighborhood impacts result from student activities.
        Expand our efforts to use community building activities and alternatives to the criminal justice system to increase civility in our neighborhoods and increase cooperation among student and non-student residents in preventing and resolving problems.
        Institute a Restorative Justice Program and a Good Neighborhood Program.]

Year to Date Financial Report Presentation - Presented by Dwight Miller on 10/23/2015,"Dwight Miller:
One thing that’s new this month in the financial report is I had a request from Mr. Rosenberger to add balance sheets to the quarterly report, so that’s new pages that you see in this month’s report. A few things I want to walk through and highlight that you see in this third quarter financial report.
(Slide one) 
Starting with the general fund, I want to point a few things out on the balance sheet. Cash is down from last year at this same time by $789,098. And Fund Balance is down from last year by $525,000. You can see those when you review the balance sheet. On the budget report, one of the things that I’ve been talking about consistently this year is the Earned Income Tax timing difference because of Penn State University converting to quarterly reporting for earned income taxes, so that continues to be an issue. Ill highlight those numbers again, as of the end of September, in just a moment. Again to remind you that we had a timing difference on the school resource officer billing this year. That is going put some extra revenue into 2015. Personnel costs for the General Fund are up $206,000 versus last year. Also if you remember, last year in the fourth quarter we revised the that way we accounted for the public works between the General Fund and the other fund, so when you look at the year to date budget reports it looks like Public Works costs are up substantially from last year. By the end of the year, that will catch itself up and so, that’s really a timing difference. We fixed that in the fourth quarter of last year, so that’ll catch itself up. And I also wanted to point out that this year in the General Fund, we did have an Inter-fund transfer of 308,000 from the General Fund to the Capital Fund, and that represented the excess Fund Balance over the reserved requirement that was transferred earlier this year. 
(Slide 2) 
This chart, again, tries to point out what’s happening with the timing difference with the earned income tax remissions from Penn State University. The highlighted area represents the month by month submissions in 2014 and year to date through August. The reason that this ends in August and I presenting September financials is because it takes a month in Centre Tax Agency before they remit to the borough, so the numbers that you see in the September financials, actually represent collections through the end of August. So last year in 2014, through the end of August, we had received 1.7 million from Penn State. And you can see this year what’s happening in the monthly variances because of the quarterly filings, and you can see it’s up and down, up and down, where last year, Penn State sent their deposits in on a monthly basis. So on a year to date basis thorough the end of August, it looks like the collections are off $338,000 versus last year. Again, that’s all timing difference because of the way that they’re submitting quarterly returns. The bottom chart here represents all other payers besides Penn State University and it shows that through the end of August we’re actually up $130,000, almost $131,000 in earned income tax. By the end of this year, we expect the impact be between $400,000 and $450,000 on the revenue for 2015 because of this timing difference.
(Slide 3) 
Moving on to the Parking Fund, I wanted to point out a few things that are concerning here. On the Balance Sheet you’ll see that cash is down from last year by $368,000. The Cash Balance in the Parking Fund as of the end of September was just a little over $1.5 million, but subsequent to that we have debt payments this fall of $1.2 million. So if you do the quick math and see that the Parking Fund is starting to run a little low on cash. When you look at Unassigned Fund Balance, that is down through the end of September versus last year, $1.5 million, and the, when you factor out the net book value of assets in the Parking Fund, the actual Unassigned Fund Balance equals $198,000 at the end of September. So the Parking Fund is continuing to deplete its Fund Balance, and it’s basically from Capital Expenditures and building repairs and debt payments. That’s an area of concern. One thing to point out again on the Budget Report, last year they were accruing 1/12th of the Annual Debt Payment each month. This year were recognizing the debt payment when it’s made like you normally would in accounting, so there’s a timing difference when you look at the budget report on that debt section. That’ll catch itself up at the end of November after we make the actual debt payment. 
(Slide 4) 
In the Capital Funds, on the Balance Sheet I want to point out that cash is down from last year by $1.4 million. The Unassigned Fund Balance is down $1.2 million. The actual balance and Unassigned Fund Balance as of the end of September in the two Capital Funds combined is $578,000. Again, that’s continuing to deplete the Fund Balance in the two Capital Funds. On the Budget Report, one of the things I wanted to talk a little about was the only sustained, regular contributions that the Capital Funds have are the Penn State impact fee and rents and depreciation transfers from the other funds for asset replacement. The difference that you see this year in the revenue, in the Capital Funds, is that $308,000 transfer from the General Fund that I talked about earlier. You look in the revenues; you’ll see that’s the cause of that variance from last year. 
That’s all I wanted to point out. ",Budget Engagement Outline
